
 
The Studios take a post-disciplinary approach to practice, where tools, techniques, media and methods are appropriated and adopted in response to the demands of a project. The Studios will help build collaborative and material skills through project- based learning where collective investigation is carried out alongside both faculty and visiting experts.
 
The programme runs for 15 months over five 10-11 week terms and is full-time (this means a minimum of 4 days per week). It is largely delivered through project briefs (both working in groups and individually), which allows an experimental and exploratory design process.

The projects open up opportunities for you to work collectively on research projects, external industry briefs and wider design research themes. Through this process, you'll evolve a design practice that is progressive but also thoughtful, critical and grounded in the complex realities of the world.
 
For Studio Expanded Practice in the first term you will also respond to a shared project brief supported by wide range of design staff from the department and guest speakers. This initial project will be run across the whole Masters programme, to build your practice working alongside and in collaboration with the diverse cohort of design students. This will be a combination of scheduled sessions (lectures, workshops, tutorials) as well as self-directed studio or fieldwork amounting to 3 days per week.
 
In addition to this project you will choose to situate yourself within a Studio, and spend one day a week in your Studio of choice, where you will be exploring discourses through talks and seminars, engaging with methods and processes appropriate to the studio's focus. This will give you a body of knowledge that will equip you to act in design in your area of interest and continue as weekly session throughout terms 1, 2 and 3.
 
In terms 2 and 3 (Design Transfocality) you will be selecting a project from a choice of three each term. Each of these projects will be made up of students from all of the Studios. The aim is to bring your interests to the particular project to shape it for the development of your own practice.
 
You return to Goldsmiths for term 5 to pull together your body of work and concluding design outcomes (culmination of Studio Expanded Practice) for public engagement through various public facing platforms (eg publication, exhibition, symposium).

Formative assessment will take place through regular tutorials, critique sessions and project presentations. Formative assessment allows students to reflect on their progress and decide areas for focus and/or improvement. Formative assessment and feedback will be facilitated by a range of department staff, as well as through peer review and inter-Studio discussion.
 
Summative assessment will take place at the end of each module. The nature of the submission will vary according to the structure and focus of the module and the modes of practice relevant to each individual Studio. Examples of summative submissions might be: oral and visual presentations, written work (essays and reports), projects and reflective portfolios.
 
This Studio facilitates conversations between making and unmaking, global and local, ethics and aesthetics, object and system, bodies and clothes. We challenge accepted boundaries and perceptions to explore fashion as a mode of collective agency. This requires questioning the relationship between fashion and consumption and generating knowledge and approaches that foster the transformative capacities of fashion and dress. We aim to broaden and reposition fashion practice through rethinking the relationships between garment, image, text, body and context to explore innovative ways of thinking, making and doing fashion.
 
This Studio explores inventive approaches to design and design-led research. We understand that the doing of design is connected to the making of the social world. We develop experiments that explore the interconnectedness of the designed social world, focusing on interactions between people and non-humans, such as technologies, infrastructures, policies and animals. We then work within these interconnected relationships to develop new interactions through material responses, and through this bring about new approaches to designing. To support this, we draw on material from design research and science and technology studies (STS). We activate our ideas in collaboration with specialists and in response to practical activities, field trips, seminars and workshops.
 
This Studio looks at design as a situated practice that can activate and transform complex sociopolitical networks. Making use of intersectional and post-colonial theories, in combination with hands-on methods and practices (counter mapping, activism, public engagement, film, installation, sound and performance), we address the structural inequalities intrinsic to the production of everyday life.
 
Graduates of the MA Design Expanded Practice can expect to enter a wide range of careers. You'll be equipped with the necessary expertise to develop a personal professional practice where you can expect to operate in roles such as:
 
Another benefit of the Masters is that during the programme you'll build creative relationships and networks beyond Goldsmiths, which could prove useful for future collaborations or professional opportunities.
 
If you don't have a related undergraduate degree we also welcome those who have significant practical experience in a design-related field: you will be judged on the relevance of your previous work experience and on your art and/or design work. We will also consider applicants who do not have a design-related background but who have engaged in research either in academia (as students or academics) or at work.
 
We will consider applications received before the end of February 2024. After this date, applications will only be considered if there are spaces remaining on the programme. As the programme attracts a very large number of applicants, we may be unable to provide feedback on your application if it arrives after the deadline.
 
There are no places offered on the programme via application alone. Selected applicants will be invited to interview once their application has been assessed. Interviews will usually take place on campus, but online interviews will be offered to overseas applicants.
 
You will also have the opportunity to present a portfolio of work that may include a range of material including sketchbooks, and samples of written assignments. The interview is an opportunity to have a conversation about Studio preferences and your portfolio, and meet some of the staff working on the programme.
 
A team of students from the Masters were invited to South Korea for the Gwangju Design Biennale 2019. From receiving funding to setting up, they reflect on the experience of exhibiting at an international design show.
 
Please note that as the MA Design: Expanded Practice is a 15-month programme. This will have implications for paying your fees if you are applying for a postgraduate loan to help fund your studies. The postgraduate loan instalments will be spread over a period of two years, with the final two loan instalments being paid after you complete your studies.
 
If you are planning to use the postgraduate loan to help pay your fees, you need to be aware that all tuition fees will need to either be paid at enrolment in September when you start your programme or via direct debit instalments, but these instalments will not be aligned with your loan. The full fee value will be due by the end of the third term (July) of the programme, prior to payment of the second year of postgraduate loan payments. Find out more about paying your tuition fees.
 
In addition to your tuition fees, you'll be responsible for any additional costs associated with your course, such as buying stationery and paying for photocopying. You can find out more about what you need to budget for on our study costs page.
 
This innovative approach to design management enables you to develop the management, enterprise and academic skills and attributes that ensure you'll know how to commercialise your practices and make social impact.

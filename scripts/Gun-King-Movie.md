You must comply with all applicable laws in your location. If you cannot legally use our services, you must stop accessing them. You must also respect all intellectual property rights and avoid posting or transmitting any content that you do not have the lawful right to make available.
 
If you encounter any inappropriate behavior or incidents in any of our games, please report them to us at reportabuse@support.king.com. Your reports are of great help to maintain a fair and enjoyable gameplay experience for everyone.
 
This Privacy Policy applies to all of our games, whether played on our website www.king.com, on mobile devices, PCs or on other platforms such as Facebook. It also applies to our 0Marketing1 and 2Advertising3 activities on all platforms and other services that we will provide to you from time to time. In this Privacy Policy we refer to our games, websites, marketing and advertising activities and other services collectively as our \"Services\".
 
Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our games, or interact with our websites, advertising or other Services. Broadly, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, how you play our games (such as levels attempted and purchases made) and will include information that you submit when creating an account with us or which you allow us to access when you connect to your social network accounts through our games or Services. We will also collect information from advertising platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about purchases and interests.
 
In some instances, when you make purchases on or through our website(s), we will collect certain payment information from you on behalf of our payment service providers, but this information is temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable by King. Unless otherwise stated we do not collect or retain credit card information. Our payment service providers will provide us with information about your purchases so that we know if a purchase has been successful.

We analyse and use the information that we collect on an de-identified or aggregated basis for product development, to analyse the performance of our games, to troubleshoot and to improve and optimise the games to ensure the best player experience for our players as a whole.
 
A more detailed description of some of the ways that we use your information is set out below and in the other sections of this Privacy Policy, including our section containing disclosures for **US residents.**
 
We use your information, including data that you provide directly to us in communications, to provide you with support through our customer service channels when you need it. We will also use it to contact you, for example as part of customer service or to send you updates about our games and Services. Finally, we will use your data to manage your account and relationship with us and improve your experience when you use our Services.
 
One of our customer service channels is the King Community website (0 1). For information about what data we collect and process when you use the King Community website, see 2Visiting our websites3 below.
 
When using online forums such as King Community, please be aware that in addition to your user name, any questions, answers, comments or submissions that you post will be publicly available and any data you provide can be read and/or used by other users. You should therefore only share content that you are comfortable sharing publicly.
 
When you play our games, we will give you a randomly generated unique identifier which we will associate with a King account known as a \"King Profile\". Your King Profile will not be personally identifiable unless you choose to add your personal information to it, such as your name, avatar, email address or other information.
 
Your King Profile and the information it contains will be visible to other users of our Services. If you choose to add personal information to your King Profile, it will be visible to your friends and other players anywhere in the world.
 
If you choose to view another individual's King Profile, that individual and other users of our Services will know that you have visited them because some of your social information and a link to your King Profile will be displayed on that individual's King Profile.
 
Where we make this available, you can choose to log in to your King Profile using your account details with a third party network, such as Facebook, Google or Apple. If you do this, you will be able to use your account to log in on multiple devices and synchronise progress across those devices. Where available, you will also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress), or access other functionality we make available in our games and other Services, such as inviting friends to play, asking other players for lives and 1-2-1 messaging.
 
If you log in to your King Profile using your Facebook account details, we will receive some of your Facebook account information. If you choose to play our games online on the desktop version of Facebook.com, your basic Facebook account information will automatically be associated with your King Profile. Exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Facebook account, but typically we will receive your basic public profile information such as your username, email address, age range, gender, chosen language, country, friends list and any other public information.
 
We will also collect the email account associated with your Facebook account and the name and avatar of those of your Facebook friends that are already playing our games. You can choose not to allow us to access your email address in the Facebook dialog box the first time at which you associate your Facebook account with your King Profile. If you provide us with your email address we will from time to time use that email address to send you marketing emails about our other games and Services. You can opt out of this at any time - see 0Opting-out of direct marketing from King1 below.
 
Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your permission and we will not receive any information about your Facebook friends who do not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook friends to be able to see you and your progression in our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting from Facebook from within our games and updating your app permissions from within your Facebook settings.
 
If you log in to your King Profile using your Google account details, we will receive some of your Google account information. Exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Google account, but typically we will receive your basic public profile information such as your name, email address and profile picture. If you choose to grant us access to your Contact List, we will use and store this to help you find those of your Google contacts that are already playing our games.
 
If you log in to your King Profile using your Apple account details, we will receive some of your Apple account information. Exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings in your Apple account, but typically we will receive your basic public profile information such as your name and email address.You can revoke future access to your information at any time by following the steps at 8 9
 
When we market our games in media published by other companies, we use various third-party marketing partners to assist us on our behalf, and we will share information which we have collected about you with such third parties for these purposes.
 
By accepting this Privacy Policy and downloading or continuing to play our games, and unless you opt out of interest-based advertising as explained in this section, you consent to our marketing partners collecting and using information about you to improve advertising, targeting and measurement systems as described in their privacy policies.
 
You should note that if you opt out of receiving interest based or targeted advertising, you will still see advertising and you will see advertising for King products, but that advertising will not be targeted using your personal information.

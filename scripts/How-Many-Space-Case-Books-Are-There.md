The posts where I explained this are now a couple years old, so I thought I would revisit the issue. The reasons I stopped writing each series are quite different.

When I first started writing this series, I really thought it might run for a long time. But I also made the decision to write a sci-fi series where space travel was depicted as realistically as possible. My good friend, astronaut Garrett Reisman, who was overseeing the human space flight program at SpaceX, served as my technical advisor. I was very pleased with the world that I created, but it had an unforeseen side effect:
 
Even worse, the only way to go outside the moon base involved wearing a space suit, which provided its own limitations. An action sequence in a space suit is very different from one where the characters are free to move about in any way they would like.

I would have been happy to write more books in this series if the publisher had supported it. But it made far more sense to write books for a more supportive publisher like Simon & Schuster instead. There is little point in writing a book that you think no one is ever going to read.
 
I am a huge fan of your books and I always buy your books as soon as they come out. I was just wondering if you are gonna make a movie about any of your books? I know you were creating a spy school movie a few years ago but it got cancelled. Are you gonna still create the spy school movie or are scraping that idea? Thanks, Alec
 
Please i honestly do not care what its about just make another mba book as long as it  
1. Has everyone in it  
2. Has the Sjobergs screwing things up  
3. Takes place at mba or mbb  
4. Is as long as the others
 
Stuart,  
 I was reading your FAQ page and was wondering if you could ask your friend who became an ASTRONAUT to respond to this question: Was it hard to become an astronaut and do you enjoy it?  
The reason I want to become an astronaut is because of your MBA series.
 
I know for a fact that Garrett enjoyed being an astronaut very much. The biggest issue was probably that he had to wait long periods of time before going into space and between trips to space, so much of being an astronaut is training.
 
I know you have said that the MBA series is over but could you possibly make a GN series of MBA and CT I have read all your books so what if you could make the GN of MBA and CT cause both books are awesome and it would be awesome if you could make the GN of both
 
if the series is about the moon base then just start a new one about bosco in the same canon. and if you choose to end another series could you please start this one again. just dont end spy school. btw this series was more intresting than spy school in some ways but i wont be able to believe that ss is over
 
In the first book, Space Case, Dash is in the bathroom when he overhears Ronald Holtz in chatting with Zan Perfonic, an alien. Dash thinks that Dr. Holtz is on the phone, as he cannot hear the other speaker, but that is not true.
 
When he wakes up the next day, the base is in chaos. Dr. Holtz is dead, and his corpse is being carried inside by Daphne Merritt and Garth Grisan. The Moon Base Commander, Nina Stack, announces that it was an accident, but Dash disagrees, believing that it is intentional murder, and gets so wrapped up in the idea that Nina forbids him to talk about it. Dash disobeys her, though.
 
A few hours later, a SpaceX Starship rocket containing supplies and astronauts lands, piloted by Katya King. Dash shows a new lunarnaut Kira Howard around, negotiating between carts of eggs and meat. When he finishes the tour and enters his residence, Zan Perfonic, posing as a temp security guard, claims that she also believes that Dr. Holtz's death wasn't accidental and asks Dash to help with detective work, starting with finding out the security tape of Dr. Holtz walking out onto the lunar surface.
 
When she questions him, Dash reveals to Kira that he believes Dr.Holtz was murdered. Kira promises not to tell anyone, as Nina would be furious, but on the condition that she would help him investigate. Dash tells Kira about the recording, and she promises to try to find it.
 
After dinner, Dash goes to Kira's residence, and watches the footage of Dr. Holtz walking out the air lock with Kira. He suddenly realizes that Dr. Holtz was using American Sign Language to say his last words before he died. He asks the computer what Dr. Holtz was saying, and it replies that he was signing 'This is a murder. Earth killed me. Find my phone. Tell my family I love them.' Dash and Kira try to figure out what he meant by 'Earth killed me', but with no success.
 
During Nina's speech at Dr. Holtz's funeral, Dash, Kira, and Roddy sneak away after realizing that Daphne is not with the other Lunarnauts. For a brief moment, Dash believes that Daphne is the killer, but they actually find her in one of the administrative offices, typing on a computer. However, Dash notes that she is acting like she is doing something wrong. when Daphne realizes that they saw her, she admits that she is a spy for Maximum Adventure. Daphne also confides in Dash and his partners that a drone has flown to a Solar Array when she didn't program it to.
 
Dash understands that this must mean that the Solar Array might be hiding Dr. Holtz's phone. Late at night, he leaves the moon base with Kira and bounds across the moon's surface to the Solar Array. Their suspicions are confirmed when they discover Dr. Holtz's phone in a Ziploc baggie. On their way back, though, the giant robot arm used for construction starts to attempt to squash Dash and Kira. Luckily for them, they are able to enter the air lock just in time, but the robot controller has already fled. Dash sets off the alarm, waking almost everybody in the base.
 
Dash and Kira try to explain their actions, showing the furious Nina Dr. Holtz's phone, but they realize that the phone was smashed during the robot arm's attack. Chang Kowalski takes the phone and attempts to salvage some data from the phone. He succeeds in recovering some of the data and invites Dash, Kira, Maxwell Howard, Nina Stack, Stephen Gibson, and Rose Harris to listen to the recording with him.
 
After hearing the recording, in which Dr. Holtz reveals that he is in contact with an alien, Nina asks if Chang can clean up the recording more, as it is in very bad shape. Chang asks the computer whether it can be done, but it mishears him. This leads Dash to realize that computers can make mistakes, and he suddenly figures out who was Dr. Holtz's murderer. Dash explains his detective work, and his mom looks at Dr. Holtz's sign language. She reveals that Dr. Holtz was saying 'Garth' instead of 'Earth', meaning Garth Grisan.
 
All of the people in the control room tear into the staging area, but Garth has already dismantled the air lock and has an oxygen tank on himself. He threatens to open the air lock, suffocating everyone, and Nina is forced to comply.
 
But suddenly, Lars Sjoberg steps out of his room and chastises everyone for waking him up with all of the noise. This distracts Garth, and Nina, Chang, and Dash's dad all wrangle Garth to the floor to arrest him. Dash detaches himself from all of the commotion and meets Zan in the greenhouse and asks her which planet she is from, showing that Dash has realized that she is the alien that Dr. Holtz was communicating with.
 
In the second book, Spaced Out, Dash is teaching Zan Perfonic about aspects of human life in the rec room, specifically Star Wars. Zan cackles madly when she sees it, finding the effects ridiculous. Suddenly, Patton and Lily Sjoberg run into the rec room looking murderous. Both interrogate Dash on where Roddy Marquez is. Dash has no idea, but Patton and Lily don't believe him and start to chase him around the moon base. Luckily, Dash is able to fend them off by forcing Patton's head into the suction part of the space toilet.
 
Nina Stack confronts Dash about this in her residence and punishes him with no CommLink privileges. Dash reasons with her that the Sjobergs were the ones who started it, but Nina is suddenly distracted by a text. She forces Dash out of her room, and he soon drifts to sleep.
 
Early in the morning, Dash is woken by his sister Violet. When they go outside, everyone is in a panic. Nina is missing, and everyone is stampeding through the base, looking for her. Violet and the other young kids believe Nina is playing hide and seek, and aren't very worried. Violet talks about DeeDah, her new friend that lives in the bathroom, but everyone perceives this as a joke.
 
Dr. Balkinov suggests that there might be a crawl-space in the base that Nina is in, and Chang agrees to check the blueprints later. Chang and Dash's parents decide to check the text that Nina got the previous night. Chang orders everyone to do what they were doing, as it was what Nina would have wanted. Dash is upset that he still has to go to school, and gets away from math class to see his parents. Dash discovers that his parents and Chang Kowalski were able to see the text on Nina's watch. It was from a person named 'Charlie', who had sent two songs, each thought to be a code of some sort.
 
While measuring the gym, Roddy suggests that Nina is made of nanobots, so she was able to hide. Fed up with Roddy's tales, Dash, his younger sister Violet, and Kira Howard all leave the gym and sneak into Nina's residence. In there, they find a teddy bear and a small space cut into Nina's sleep pod, under her air mattress. They manage to get it open, and find a pile of valuable moon rocks. When they return, they tell Chang, who realizes

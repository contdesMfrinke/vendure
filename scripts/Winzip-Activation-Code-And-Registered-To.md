I am having a hard time getting my WinZip installation to recognize the WinZip.wzmul Multi-User Registration File. I am on a Windows XP and have put the WinZip.wzmul inside of C:\Program Files\WinZip. However, when I start WinZip by going to Start -> WinZip 15.0, it says this copy of WinZip is not yet registered, and that I need an registration/activation code. This webpage says that the presence of WinZip.wzmul in this folder will convert WinZip to a licensed, registered version but this is not the case in this situation. Any recommendations? Thanks.
 
I dont know if this still holds true, but in the past all you had to do was double click the .wzmul file to register. I would keep the .wzmul file with the WinZip MSI file on a network share, and after installing WinZip from the MSI, I would double click the .wzmul file and that would complete the registration.

Customers who purchase a multi-user license will receive a unique WinZip.wzmul registration file which must be copied to a WinZip subfolder in the Windows Common AppData folder. This folder contains application data for all users. For Windows 7 and Windows Vista, a typical path for the WinZip.wzmul file is C:\ProgramData\WinZip. For Windows XP and Windows 2000, a typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WinZip. The presence of WinZip.wzmul in this folder will convert WinZip to a licensed, registered version.
 
I have a T-SQL Task set up to use a Winzip command line for zipping a file. There are no parameters going into the task, but there is a single row result set up to get the name of the zip file and pass it to the next task. Unfortunately, I get a Winzip message instead of my file name. It's driving me NUTS.
 
Thing is, I run this script in SSMS and I end up with the correct value in my SELECT. But as soon as I'm running it in SSIS, I'm getting output that is throwing itself in my result variable and overwriting my file name.

I appreciate the thought, but I'm trying to avoid adding additional tasks into the package if I don't have to. If I were to do that, I'd just use another Execute SQL task to read the directory and grab the max zip package name (which is doable and will work, but doesn't resolve the issue I want to resolve).
 
To answer earlier questions, yes, my copy of Winzip is registered. EDIT: Wayne, I'm running this in BIDS. So far as I can tell, it's using my credentials (which are the same as the ones I'm using in SSMS and in remote desktop for a direct login to the server). But I will verify that.

So, apparently my "no output" statement doesn't completely kill the proprietary information in SSIS, even if I don't see it in SSMS (which I don't). So why does the result still get overridden if I move the SELECT statement above the Exec statement?
 
Lowell--help us help you! If you post a question, make sure you include a CREATE TABLE... statement and INSERT INTO... statement into that table to give the volunteers here representative data. with your description of the problem, we can provide a tested, verifiable solution to your question! asking the question the right way gets you a tested answer the fastest way possible!
 
No, Lowell. Not easy at all. And it's not about price. Approvals have to go through our Corporate office. Applications are rigorously testing to make sure they are compatible with existing software & hardware, as well as tested to make sure they don't violate our privacy policies and any laws (HIPAA, SOX, etc.).
 
That aside, if anyone can help me with my original problem, I'd really appreciate it. I have a couple of work arounds, but I'd like to solve the original issue (the result set not filling in properly) if I can.
 
We used to use WinZip and bought one for each PC up to v9, after which the massive cost decided us to go for 7zip instead. I pushed this out and did my best to remove Winzip from the PCs (this predates KACE so wasn't all too successful, it left the Add Remove entry)
 
I'm trying to create a Software item to filter for PCs that actually have Winzip. So far so good as I am checking for programfiles\winzip\winzip32.exe but is there something I can check to see if the installed copy is the registered or eval version?

WinZip 25 (Build 10661) delivers an entirely new, Office 2010-style, user interface and unveils numerous key features that dramatically simplify the product. See What's New in WinZip 25 for more information.
 
**Important:** If you are a registered user of a previous WinZip version, please note that you are about to overwrite your registered copy with WinZip 25 , which will run in unregistered, evaluation mode until you either enter a new registration code or revert to your previous version. For help with trying before buying, visit the Upgrade Information page.
 
In addition, the application sends out potentially sensitive information like the registered username, registration code and some other information in query string as a part of the update request. Since this is over an unencrypted channel this information is fully visible to the attacker.
 
A second issue I discovered is that WinZip 24 opens pop-up windows time to time when running in Trial mode. Since the content of these popups is HTML with JavaScript that is also retrieved via HTTP, it makes manipulation of that content easy for a network adjacent attacker. In the end, malicious actors can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code as in previous scenario.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
 
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".
 
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
 
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
 
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

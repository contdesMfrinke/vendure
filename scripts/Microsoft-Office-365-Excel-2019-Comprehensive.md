
 
By providing a specific cell reference of column and row, ChatGPT will include the exact formula into its response making it easier for the user to copy and paste the result into their own Excel spreadsheet.
 
By describing the process you want to automate in Excel, ChatGPT will create a script on your behalf that you can copy and paste into the VBA editor. **(You can launch the editor by pressing Alt + F11 on Windows)**

The search terms range from non-sensical sentences, to brief queries that you would put into a search engine for a broad range of related topics. Putting the data into ChatGPT makes data categorization much easier than trying to determine related keywords in an Excel Pivot Table
 
**Note:**The first time we ran this test, ChatGPT errored out after taking a couple of minutes to attempt the initial calculation. We are using ChatGPT Plus which provides users with priority access and occurs very rarely.
 
**ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis**uses the Python Programming Language to make adjustments to the formatting of Excel files, and to analyze the data inside of the excel sheet. While not all python libraries are available at this time, it supports two of the biggest excel analytics packages, Numpy and Pandas.
 
ChatGPT has improved to the point where it will begin to ask follow-up questions when a prompt is vague. The spreadsheet we uploaded into the example had sales quantity and sales dollar data. We were prompted to clarify our request. Upon clarification, ChatGPT moves forward with performing analysis on the spreadsheet data.
 
**Tip:**After completing the analysis, you can ask ChatGPT to export a file to .xlsx, .csv and a number of other file formats. It will generate a file and allow you to download the completed dataset.
 
Data can be exported from ChatGPT to an Excel file using ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis functions if you have a subscription to ChatGPT Plus. After ChatGPT answers a question, you can ask it to export a file to a .xlsx or a .csv file and it will generate a version that can be downloaded.

In instances of large data sets, ChatGPT will present you with a preview of the first ten rows of a data set, and then ask you if you want to generate a full file. The amount of compute power that ChatGPT allocates to the request appears to be improving over time. We have been able to prompt ChatGPT to generate Excel files of 100,000 rows.
 
There is no specific file size limit on what ChatGPT can generate, but it will only allocate up to 60 seconds to the creation of a dataset, meaning that the limit is on compute time more than it is on the ability to handle big data sets.
 
The Microsoft Office Add-ins store is available directly from Excel. **Go to Insert > Get Add-Ins** and you can search for many of the other AI powered Excel add-ins currently available at a range of difference price points.
 
In May of 2023, Microsoft announced Copilot 365. Copilot is the brand name of integrating a ChatGPT style natural language interface across the entire Microsoft Office Suite of applications. Direct integration of ChatGPT is coming soon to Excel.
 
The video below was published by Microsoft, highlighting their vision of the many features that will eventually make their way into Excel. Some of the areas that we are most excited about is the ability to ask questions about our data, and create data visualizations on command.
 
Microsoft announced pricing of $30 USD per user per month for commercial customers. Pricing has not been announced at this time for non-commercial customers or retail SKUs of Microsoft Copilot features. The exact details of which SKUs the pricing applies to is as follows:
 
**Microsoft 365 Copilot will be available for commercial customers for USD30 per user per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium customers when broadly available.**
 
The way that Microsoft has made the announcement makes us wonder if commercial customers will be prioritized in releasing ChatGPT integration into the office applications. There is a known limitation of cloud compute power available to support the demand for natural language processing. Microsoft may not have the resources available to launch a wide range of AI features across all Microsoft Office users globally.
 
The proliferation of Python across the Microsoft ecosystem would enable them to have one set of AI tools that are highly trained on performing tasks in a single programming language. It would be easier to scale and deploy across products while using a single pre-trained AI model.
 
For reference, check out this video from 2017 that summarizes state of the art AI models at the time. They look ancient compared to the Large Language Models that we use today like ChatGPT or Google Bard.
 
AI models will continue to improve, and they will improve at an ever increasing rate. There may be a terminal level where they can only advance up to a certain point until margin gains are made but only time will tell.
 
We expect that OpenAI will either find a way to improve their AI model, or simply adjust it so that it knows when to invoke a different model or technique to complete computations efficiently and accurately.
 
This is already becoming a feature in early stages as presented with ChatGPt plugins and Code Interpreter. Ideally the end user will have no idea which model is being used and they can ask a question to receive an accurate answer.
 
One of the more interesting use cases we found with ChatGPT was sending a list of questions from an Excel spreadsheet to ChatGPT. This can be a time consuming task of copying and pasting questions and responses.
 
Microsoft knows that Fortune 100 companies will not use ChatGPT and their Azure OpenAI Cognitive services unless these companies can keep their data separate from the public and control access at a very granular level even within their own organization.
 
With the recent release of ChatGPT Advanced Avanced Data Analysis, please can upload Excel, CSV, or even PDF files and ask questions about their data. An added benefit is that you can ask ChatGPT to perform additional operations, such as remove blank rows, create a summary table etc. Some features work better than others but will improve over time.
 
Users will not only be able to complete analysis faster, but it may mean that analysts will be able to perform tasks that IT historically had to be involved in such as data integration, connecting systems together, or allowing novice Excel users to write complex SQL queries.
 

This page compares the features of **LibreOffice** and **Microsoft Office** in several form factors. The comparisons separate major and minor feature differences and also includes notes on LibreOffice extensions. The comparison highlights differences and therefore does not display any features which are present in both office suites.
 
**The feature comparison table is continuously being updated and is work in progress.**
It is a compilation by users and **not** an official document by the Document Foundation.

For operations that involve reading and loading or writing data, such as opening a file, saving a file or refreshing data, splitting the operation into two processes increases performance speed. The first process gets the data, and the second process loads the data into the appropriate structure in memory or writes the data to a file. In this way, as soon as the first process begins reading a portion of data, the second process can immediately start loading or writing that data, while the first process continues to read the next portion of data. Previously, the first process had to finish reading all the data in a certain section before the second process could load that section of the data into memory or write the data to a file.

LibreOffice has a complex eco-system of extensions (over 600 on extensions.libreoffice.org and over 800 on extensions.openoffice.org). Additionally to the extensions already mentioned in above comparison table, here is a selection of some extensions adding valuable features to LibreOffice:
 
**Android**: Collabora Office on Google Play available for smartphones and tablets, release announcement (2019-12-10). LibreOffice Viewer for Android available, with basic and experimental editing features. Information on new LibreOffice Android app: [137]. More information: Android port wiki, Commits, [138], [139].
 
**iOS/iPadOS:** Collabora Office for iPhone and iPad available: Collabora Office in the Apple AppStore. More information: Collabora press release, Adfinis press release, LibreOffice as an iOS app on the iPad; Announcement for iOS; Commits: [140], [141].
 
Professional users as well as users on tablets >10.1 inch are required to have an eligible Office 365 subscription at a monthly fee. Private users are allowed to view and print documents without registration private users, basic editing functionality requires registration. More comprehensive features require an eligible Office 365 subscription at a monthly fee.
 
**Chromebooks are in this Online office suite section for several reasons:**
LibreOffice core software is available as a Chromebook App from Collabora Productivity by the name of Collabora Office, it is the same software as used in the Online suite with some optimisations for ChromeOS. In Sept 2021 Microsoft announced the discontinuation of their Chromebook App. By combining Online and Chromebook Apps in this table it enables the easy comparison of LibreOffice based office suites to Microsoft's Online when using a Chromebook.

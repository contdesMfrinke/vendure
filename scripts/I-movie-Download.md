Is the quality as good recording directly into i Movie. Or is it better to record to Garage Band and then import over the Audio and strip it in... ? Or go ahead record it in I movie as a VO... then export it to GB or Logic to EQ the Vocal then strip it back into i Movie? Hmmm... hope thats clear.. Its a paying gig and I want the best VO Quality possible but it must flow with the Video... Thanks.. Joe.

Yes, audio is not a strong suit in iMovie. Not much in the way of adjustment controls. Then again, iMovie is a free simplified consumer app, not a pro app. Final Cut Pro X would be the pro app, but that costs $300.
 
In the pop up box that appears you will see your external mic as a selection option. You might need to go to Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI set-up.app and make sure that your external mic is selected in the sidebar.
 
I don't use GarageBand, but since it shares the same internal mic as iMovie I would assume the sound quality would be the same. Probably more audio tools in GarageBand. However, I am no expert in sound recording. The pro's have fancy microphones for that work.

I think that you'll need to experiment, perhaps with a small test movie, and see what sound quality is satisfactory to you. The voice over feature in iMovie would be the easiest to use. The voice quality is adequate, although I wouldn't say that it is super terrific. As with any audio that is not recorded in the same locality as the video it could sound a little like an add in. But it might sound natural enough for your purposes with the video you are working with. Perhaps using voice over with an external mic would yield better results.
 
In the old days before we had voice over, I used to record separate audio on my camera and then import the audio-video clip into iMovie and split out the audio. That seemed to give a natural voice, particularly if recorded in the same vicinity as the video was taken, and with the same camera. You would need to make the audio recording while running your movie in iMovie so that it matches up with the video when you import it in.

The following is a prayer (stotram) that can be chanted by girls for early and good marriages. It is also a prayer for conceiving. (This can be used as prayer for TTC, for those undergoing IVF and other fertility treatments)
 
For conception, the priests at Garbarakshambigai Temple strongly recommend taking ghee prasadam for 48 days while chanting the stotram. If you would like to receive the prasadam from the temple then we perform the puja on your behalf and get you the prasadam.

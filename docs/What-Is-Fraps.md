Is it possible to detect what applications are using OpenGL or DirectX similar to what FRAPS does? (Possibly using some form of hook)? I probably won't need to actually draw to the window, I just need to know what processes are doing some form of 3D rendering for the time being.

(Edit:)In case you are not familiar with it, FRAPS is a program that can be used to draw a "Frame-per-second" counter on a 3D application. FRAPS finds all running 3D applications by itself without needing you to specify the process name.
 
Probably the simplest way is to check for the presence of the OpenGL and DirectX core libraries, probably also a good idea to add in the driver OGL dlls in too (such as nvogl), this can be done via EnumProcesses & EnumProcessModulesEx, using p/invoke, this will at least give you a starting set of processes possibly using OGL or DX.
 
Of course some applications load both of the API's and use only one, or only conditionally useone of the GFX API's (though the latter only occurs with specialized tools and the like), for this, IMO, the best way to check is to perform some form of injectionor attaching to the process like a debugger would, then hooking either Present for DX or wglSwapBuffers for OGL.

From what I understand, FRAPS uses a relatively brute force approach to determining where to lay down shop. The process gets started with SetWindowsHookEx to request that the OS load the FRAPS hook DLL into every running process it can [and future processes]. The magic in the DLL comes down to running a procedural set of tests using GetModuleHandleA to observe if the process it is attached to has loaded any OpenGL/DirectX modules. If all calls return NULL, the hook attempts to remove itself from the process.
 
On the other hand, if the process has loaded them, it simply hooks the appropriate rendering function from that library by removing protection and injecting a JMP hook. wglSwapBuffers is typically the only relevant one in OpenGL. When the process calls this function, it ends up calling the FRAPS module and then FRAPS captures the back buffer into its queue for encoding to AVI and renders its little indication. Then it processes the original request for wglSwapBuffers and returns the execution back to the program.
 
I get this weird thing where fraps style green FPS counter displays on every UI element. It turns on randomly and I could not determine if any speciffic action caused this. Really distracting and also obscures UI. This happens on many Unity versions, multiple computers, even after clean windows installation. On Both Nvidia and AMD graphics. Any idea why does this happen and how to disable it?
 
This method is easy to accomplish and works with almost any application, which is what makes FRAPS so versatile. When it comes to measuring the average FPS over a benchmark run for example, FRAPS is great because every Present call it sees will eventually end up triggering a frame to be displayed. The average framerate is merely the number of Present calls FRAPS sees, divided by how long FRAPS was running for.
 
GPUView is a GPU performance profiling tool, and it gives very near a top-to-bottom overview of the rendering pipeline. GPUView can see the command buffers, the Present calls, the context queue, the CPU utilization of various threads, the drivers, and more. In fact short of being able to tell us the simulation time, GPUView is the kind of massive data dump a GPU developer, programmer, or even reviewer could ever want.
 
The second slide is of GPUView with Unigine Heaven, presenting us with a textbook situation of where the GPU is the bottleneck, as Heaven is designed from the start to be a GPU benchmark and has limited CPU usage as a result. Of note, we can see the behavior of Heaven as it waits for the context queue to open up to take another frame. Heaven runs with the standard context queue limit of 3, and we can clearly see the 3 Presents, representing the 3 frames in the queue.
 
I've got a two monitor flight sim setup. I use the monitor directly in front as my main monitor, with it set to forward-looking virtual cockpit most of the time. Second monitor (on left, angled 45 deg.) is the one I use for all other views. Here's my problem: I wanted to use Fraps to record views on my second (side) monitor but discovered Fraps would only record from the monitor that I had declared in Display settings to be the main monitor, i.e., straight ahead. Bummer. Not what I wanted 'cause I don't like flying with my head turned sideways. Then I accidentally discovered that if I didn't display the FSX main screen on the forward-looking monitor at full screen but left a 1/8" margin, Fraps would record from the side monitor--exactly what I wanted! If you disable the red letter messaging while you're recording movies, you can get clean movies with no FSX message clutter.
 
Ever thought about what goes into this foamy pleasure? Well, it contains vanilla syrup, which again, contains sugar. According to this website, the amount of whipped cream on a tall frappucino equals 80 calories. Why is Starbucks doing this to me?
 
As other options described above are all fine, i still want to reccomend you msi afterburner. It will let you setup whatever you want on screen like a fps counter, but also gpu load, temps, power etc. The same for cpu. You can all edit this yourself to only show what you need. For your case it would be an fps counter ans maybe gpu load.
 
Yea I use GeForce experience, I believe the key is alt+z but I could be wrong. From there, go to performance. To toggle on/off, I believe it is alt+r. Again, could be wrong about the keybinds, thats the way I have it setup though.
 
If you have the Steam installation of MSFS, there is a nice, low-impact FPS counter. In the Steam application, go to Settings/In-Game, and there is a box you can check for In-Game FPS counter, and options for where to put it and visibility.
 
Today, as I was talking with Dr. Jessica Pierce about dogs engaging in what I call high-energy fits, she alerted me to the fact that these are typically called "zoomies" or Frenetic Random Activity Periods, often referred to as FRAPs. I didn't know this and really wasn't surprised that they've already been labeled because they're pretty common and lots of fun in which to engage and to watch.
 
Zoomies/FRAPS are high-energy bursts of activity in which a dog looks like s/he is possessed, after which they often lie down exhausted as if they've run a marathon or played to their heart's content and need a break. On these zoomies, some dogs chase their tail until they spin so fast they fall over, only to do it again and again, some dash here and there but somehow seem to know the dimensions of their body and rarely run into an object, other dogs, or people, and then there's Darwin "the water fountain frapper dog."
 
Darwin truly is a frapper in all his glory. He's not only a water frapper, but also wired in other situations. He's really a frapper generalist. Watching Darwin, I often laughed uncontrollably, and I always thought it would be a wonderful project to study his obsession with water and his zoomies in more detail. Two of the dogs with whom I shared my home engaged in zoomies regularly, although they got in at least 3 to 4 miles of walking and running a day. The urge to engage in a FRAP built up and they just did it.
 
Is it okay for dogs to engage in zooms or frapper fugues? Yes, it is. I spend a lot of time at dog parks and people often ask me if it's okay for dogs to engage in zoomies. My answer is always something like, "Yep, as long as you're sure that she or he won't harm themselves or others and it's done in a safe area." And, it's essential for a human to know their dog and to remain alert when either the dog or other individuals are in the path of a frapper fugue and potentially can be harmed.
 
There always seem to be naysayers, and a few people told me they were emphatically told that zoomies aren't a good idea because dogs can hurt themselves or others. While I can't find any data on this aspect of frapper fugues, I'm always amazed at how few zoomies turn into something bad or injurious. When I asked dog park humans about this, they all agreed that very few, if any, resulted in any harm to a dog, other dogs, or the hysterical humans who, on some occasions, are laughing so hard they're tearing up. On occasion, I've seen a dog turn an ankle or shoulder, but never have I seen this result in anything other than a momentary break on a FRAP.
 
My advice is to let 'em FRAP, let 'em engage in frapper fugues if they enjoy them, and be sure that you watch them romping here and there and prevent any injuries that might result from these mindless fits. Many dogs really enjoy zoomies and if they didn't, it's highly likely they wouldn't engage in them. Zoomies surely are part of what it's like to be a dog.
 
As with other aspects of dog behavior, detailed studies of zoomies are sorely needed, and I look forward to seeing the results of these projects. I know for sure that whoever does the research will find it to be a lot of fun. And, who knows, they might jump right in, zoom themselves, and thoroughly enjoy fugues of fun.
 
Please stay tuned for more discussion of the cognitive and emotional lives of dogs and other animals. There's lots to learn and it can be a good deal of fun to discover what's happening in their heads and hearts.
 
It's a good thing that this is Early Access and we've all volunteered to help test and enhance this work in progress... despite the frustrations inherent in the task with even the simplest of software... otherwise people might not understand that this incredibly complex unfinished module is unfinished. /light-hearted sarcasm
 
I dunno what the issue is. But I've tried RCtrl+pause and LCtrl+pause and b

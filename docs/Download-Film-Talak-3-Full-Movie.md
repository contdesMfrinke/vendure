Talak was born in Comba, Margao, Goa, India. He attended the Mahila Nutan and Popular High Schools in Margao and later joined Parvatibai Chowgule College, from which he graduated with a bachelor's of science. He was a state-ranked Table tennis player, and represented his college in Table tennis and Badminton competitions.
 
In the 1970s, Talak was a part of Tabla player Sushant Keshav Naik's *Mahesh Kumar & Party* music group. The group merged into the *Gomant Vidya Niketan Kala Vibha*, and staged award-winning dramas in Marathi. Talak's experience in drama and theatre led him to develop a passion for cinema. While composing the music for their play, *Shitu*, Talak decided that the story was worth making into a movie, beginning his journey into filmmaking.[1]
 
Talak began his career with the tele-film *Shitu* in 1994, which was based on a child widow. Talak received praise for this film from director Shyam Benegal, whom he had invited for the film's release.[1]
 
In 2002, Talak decided to make a film about the pollution caused by mining in Goa. Upon learning that Goa would host the International Film Festival of India in 2004, Talak quickly finished the shooting and post production of *Aleesha*. The film premiered at the 35th International Film Festival of India and went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Konkani at the 52nd National Film Awards.[1][3]
 
His next film was bilingual, titled *Antarnad* in Konkani and *Savalee* in Marathi, and premiered at the IFFI 2006. It won five national awards and seven state awards. He then made another bilingual film, "*Saavariyaa.com"* in 2009, about 'internet marriages' in Goa.[4] Rajendra Talak's 2010 film, *O Maria*, dealt with the loss of identity that Goa faced and was a commercial success in the state.[1][2][5][6]

On 22 November 2018, at the 49th International Film Festival of India, delegates who had gathered to watch the Danish crime thriller, "*The Guilty"* began protesting at Kala Academy when they were not allowed to enter the theater. This led to an argument between them and the organizers, in which Talak was quoted as asking delegates from Kerala to "go back home". A complaint was filed by Kerala-based director Kamal KM to IFFI CEO, Ameya Abhyankar. Following this, 29 other Malayali delegates, including 11 National Film winners like Dileesh Pothen and Dr Biju, signed a petition requesting a formal apology from Talak. When asked to comment, Talak replied that he had simply told the delegates to go back as the show was completely booked.[9][10]
 
Talak also runs a construction business named "Talak Constructions". He also co-founded the "Kalangan Centre for Performing Arts" in Margao, of which he has previously been the president.[1] Talak has planted trees under the Swachh Bharat Mission in his hometown of Margao. He helps in the landscaping of mini gardens in the city.[1]
 
Without the state supporting various aspects of filmmaking, it's impossible for the industry to grow. We have to level the playing field if we want to make better films. Today Korean, Iranian, and Israeli films owe their success at home and abroad to protectionist state policies.
 
Filmmakers have adopted guerrilla style techniques; they share production costs and undertake their own film distribution with marketing and PR campaigns tailored for specific film projects.
 
Film critic Yangesh is quick to point out that these emergent themes underscore the social, political, and cultural transition sweeping post-conflict Nepal. Another telling indication of change, he says, is reflected in the current crop of actors. They no longer resemble the archetypical Kollywood superstars.

The 1980s in Bollywood is filled with works that can be considered classics: From the likes of Aakrosh, starring Naseeruddin Shah, to the dramatic The Burning Train, starring the late Vinod Khanna, there were films of all kinds, each dealing with a different concept, with some popcorn films and some films a reflection of the times and of the culture prevalent in the era. One such film was 'Nikaah', by B.R. Chopra.

Although even to those people who grew up on a diet of movies of old, the film may have flown under the radar, in the days of its release and those preceding it, the film drew quite a bit of attention to itself. The reason for it was its original title: 'Talaq, Talaq, Talaq'.

Set in the city of Hyderabad, the film dealt with the stigma of the triple talaq issue which has now found itself returning to the mainstream following a series of petitions and the subsequent ban from the Supreme Court, followed the life of Niolfar, played by Salma Agha, who is unknowingly the object of affection of Haider, played by Raj Babbar, who doesn't know she is engaged to Wasim, played by Deepak Parashar, who turns out to be a workaholic with little patience, and after endless tension between the couple, which culminates in a wedding anniversary party gone horribly bad, resulting in Wasim issuing divorce to Nilofar by saying 'talaq, talaq, talaq'.

The film's title's change had an interesting angle, in that B.R. Chopra's Muslim friend was the reason. Bengali Daily 'Ei Samay' ran a small article, which says that the Muslim friend said that "Chopra Saab, there's a problem. I won't be able to go home and ask my wife to go watch the film. Because when she asks what film I'm asking her to watch and if I tell her the name of the film (which was Talaq Talaq Talaq), she'll get a heart attack,". Seeing the issue the title could very well cause, Chopra changed the title to Nikaah, which was also one of the core angles of the film.

The film hit some very sensitive topics for Muslim people at the time, with over 34 cases filed against it, a record for any film of the period. The director even went out of his way to give an advisory to the people about the intent of the film and had to resort to a special screening with a properly placed explanation of the film's content to get the orthodox Muslims to rescind their protest. 

 
The film went on to become a super hit and there was no looking back for Kashyap, who credits director D Rajendra Babu for encouraging him through his journey. Karulina Koogu , Sihi Muttu, Super Ranga, Uppi 2, Kaafi Thota, Bhuvana Jyoti, and Shaapa are some of the films he is known for. He even won the Karnataka State Award for best cinematographer for Shaapa in 2001 .

**5.** *Mushu continues to indulge himself and gets into his "royal" bath, splashing the ancestor spirits in the process.* Ignoring how Mushu's ego has been egregiously pushed to Damian-Wayne levels, these ancestor spirits are not solid and therefore should not be able to have water splayed on them.

**6.** *Credits role in a similar style painted opening to the original*. Sequel tries to be the original via title sequence two minutes in, when it took place at the beginning of the original.
 
**8. *Grandma:****(Noticing Mulan's mother pacing nervously)* *"Relax child, I know that Shang will arrive at any minute to propose to Mulan."*What do you mean propose? You're her family. You are the ones who decide who she will marry. Oh that's right, I forgot what I was watching.
 
**12.** *Introduction of Mulan practicing her moves, using her rake as a staff. She is taken by surprise by fifteen young girls who try to emulate her.* Awww, it's adorable, a neighborhood following consisting of what could qualify as rascist stereotypes.

**-13.***Mulan leads into the song Lesson Number One*. For what it's worth, this is a very good song with a good, provocative message; it's no I'll Make a Man Out of You, but hey, it's masterwork next to others I've heard in the long line-up of cheapquels.
 
**18.** *The family is watching from afar. **Father:**(to grandma) "You bet that he would propose to her before sundown. I proposed it would be before noon." **Mother:** "But you don't gamble." **Father:** "When it's among family, it's not gambling, it's an investment."* Just one small example of the many terrible messages sent to kids in this movie.
**
19.** *Mush is bawling happily for Mulan. **Mushu:** "It seems only last month you and I was savin' China!" **Mulan:** "It WAS last month."* Mulan and Shang have only known each other for one month before he proposed, which may contribute to some of the ultimate discomfort we will encounter later on in this movie. Did ancient Chinese measure months in the same incriment of time as we do?

 
**20.** ***Mulan:** "You are the best friend anyone could ask for." Mushu starts tearing up from that. **Mushu:** "Oh, Mulan, I'm just so happy for me!" **Mulan:** "So my getting married is best for you?"* You know, you should take that as a direct compliment when a sidekick says it, Mulan-especially when that's the type of thing that every Chinese family, but yours, says to their daughters in this day and age.
 
**23.** *Shang brings Mulan out front to show her that she has invited "all of China" for a celebration.* Apparently, for what qualifies as "all of China", the country's population has dwindled significantly since the last movie-referring to the scene of the first movie where Mulan had all of China bow before her.

 
**24.** *They all bow before the couple to the sound of a stereotypical gong.* Stereotypical Chinese gong. I could make a drinking game for how many reccurances it has in this movie-although given some of my past drinking-game experiences, I've decided that maybe that's not the best option.
 
**34. *Emperor:****"Instead, we will form a forge so strong, the mongols won't dare attack. With the kingdom of Qigong, we will become united through marriage. You will escort three princesses there, where they will marry the lord Chin's son, and seal this critical alliance." **Mulan:** "What?!"*If you pause this scene for a minute, you'll notice that Mulan makes a subtle derp face for a moment-that's almost on par with Belle's infamous deep face. (Keyword being 'almost'.)
 
**Emperor:***"If this wedding does not take place in three days, the alliance will crumble, and the mongols will destroy us."* Remember this line as well. It too will come back to bite this movie in the ass at the end. (Nay, this line will take a bite at this movie and end up devouring it whole.)
 
**37. *Matchmaker:****"I've found wives for hundreds of men, but the Golden Dragon of Unity himself could not find matches for you three! Come back when you have personalities."* I have a sister who studies international diplimacy, so I'm going to call bullsh\*t on the 'Dragon of Unity' mythos (even though it will frequently come back up throghout this movie). But I'll give Disney the benefit of the doubt and just assume it might be an allegory for an icon or part of a belief system that does exist and just has to be condensed for film's sake. But trust me, I will only let the lack of evidence on this matter slide so far...
 
**38. *Yao:****"All asked for was a girl who worships the dirt I walk on." **Chen Po:** "I simply asked for a girl who would cook for me morning noon and night." **Ling:**"And I only wanted a girl who likes to laugh-and thinks I'm a god."* What difference would it make for any of these three? In this culture, it's pretty much established that women have to adapt to men's standards. They'd pretty much have everything owed to them any day.

**39.***The three of them do a reprise of A Girl Worth Fighting For.* Only three songs in this entire movie, and of course, ONE of them has to be a reprise.
 
**41.** *The three get thrown out of a bar at the end of the song sequence, where Mulan and Shang are waiting for them. **Shang:** "If you three aren't too busy disturbing the peace, I need you to join Mulan and me on a mission." **Ling:** "To save China?" **Mulan:** "Naturally." **Yao:** "I'll be leaving behind a few broken hearts, but count me in!"* Yao is clearly trying to cover the fact that he, Chen Po and Ling haven't found love interests after contributing to the rescue of the emperor in the last movie.
 
**42**. *Fade to the next scene of the back of the palace where the three princesses, **Mei**, **Ting-Ting**, and **Su** are being bid farewell by the emperor and being coaxed into a carriage by Shang, while Yao, Ling and Chen Po stand guard.* *One of the princesses has a shoe slip off. Yao rushes fourth to put it back onto her, and the two are momentarily caught in a trance with each other.* And this one little first glance sets fourth a whole chain of events throughout this movie...
 
**47.** *Next scene of Shang asking Mulan what she's unhappy about. **Shang:** "What's with the face?" **Mulan:** "What face?" **Shang:** "THAT face?" **Mulan:** "There's no face. This is MY face."* "I mean at least it's not that derp face I was making in an earlier scene, right?"
 
**49. *Shang:****"Mulan, you're only duty is to the emperor." **Mulan:** "But Shang, an arranged marriage?" **Shang:** "I know, but not everyone can be as lucky as we are. In an ideal world everyone can marry for love. But the world isn't perfect. I'm just glad my world is."* You know what, forget what I said about making a drinking game out of all the times you hear a stereotypical Chinese gong. I think I could instead make a drinking game about all the things these characters say or all the details this movie sets up that will turn around to come and bite it in the ass later.
 
**50. *Mushu:****"MY world. Talk about selfish! You don't hear me bragging about how it's MY world-even though it pretty much is! I'm telling ya Crikee, the faster I bust 'em apart, the better things will be for Mulan."* I don't know if I'd call this the worst of all the cheapquels, but with Mushu being such a prick, I can unhesitantly say that it is among the most uncomfortable.
 
**53.** *Cut to inside of the cart. **Mei:** "Did you see the way he looked at me?" **Ting-Ting:** "Who? That big gorilla with the bad eye?"* Hey! HEY! Have you ever seen a gorilla? Or any animal that isn't native to your own country?!

 
**60.** *Everyone packs up to resume the journey and Mei speaks to Mulan. **Mei:** "You were so brave to take your father's place in the army. Your duty was to stay home, but your heart told you to break the rules. How did you decide between duty and heart?" **Mulan:** "Well, it wasn't easy. But by following my feelings, I ended up doing the right thing. I guess I realized that my duty is to my heart."* Okay, breaking the law to spare a father's demise in battle is one thing, but THAT one little act that would have caused Mulan to be executed had it failed, most likely not have left China open for invasion if Mulan had not succeeded-except that it might lead to some sort of paradox with Mulan being the one who crushed the Hun army. What I'm essentially saying is, THINK THROUGH YOUR IMPLICATIONS BEFORE YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN, WRITERS! 

 
**61.** *Next scene has to do with montages of Mushu trying to make Shang look like a fool in front of Mulan, only to have Mulan find it charming*. Two decade-old clichs of a "comedic" foils plans going awry and a girl finds a guy's klutziness charming.
 
**62.** *Montage scene involves Shang gets chased by bees, by a bear, and by rodents-including a skunk*. Putting aside the major dis-service this does to Shang's peronna of an uncomprimising leader, do skunks live in China???

 
**-61.** *Mushu watches in agitation as his attempts fail. Then Kahn the horse spots him and mercilessly stomps on him in the brush.* I'm not sure whether to remove a sin on account of Mushu getting his cummupence or to add one on account of Kahn being a dick to a character who's being an uncharacteristic dick. Ah screw it, I'll remove a sin, because I'm such a generous guy and because I wouldn't call this the worst of the Disney cheapquels-although it certainly is one of the more uncomfortable ones to sit through, and trust me, the Sin Total WILL reflect that.

 
**-60** **. *Mushu:****(all bandaged and casted up) "I try and I try. I put my whole heart and soul into busitn' 'em up. And what do I have to show for it?" Crikee smirks from the sidelines.* Well, at least the Cricket is someone else I can root for in this mess of a movie, so I shall generously retract another sin.

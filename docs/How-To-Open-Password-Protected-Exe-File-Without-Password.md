I have an Excel file that is password protected. When I log in to the account from the computer and try to open the file, I click on it but there is no option or access to type the password to open the file. This only happens on the account from the computer and not on the account from the mobile phone (where I have the option to type in the file password). I click on the blue "Open" button and then click on the link to Excel - and it shows me an error message and does not give access to typing the password of the file. As a result, I currently do not have any access to the file from my computer. How can I solve this ??

I have to open an excel file every day and refresh the content to get the newest sales-data. I'd like to automate this with windows task scheduling. Since the excel-file is password protected, i read that the best way is to create another excel file with an workbook\_open-macro that opens the desired excel-file.The problem though is, that the code i found still prompts the user to enter the password. I can just hit enter and it'll open then, but why is there still the prompt for it? I am using Excel 365, is there some workaround for this or am i doing something wrong?
 
It is not possible to save a password protected file without a password with Adobe Reader, you would require Adobe Acrobat to remove the password protection. Even with Adobe Acrobat you can only remove the security if you are aware about the password otherwise you need to contact the Author/creator of the PDF to remove the security.
 
Not sure if this is helpful.. I was needing to combine some statements into one PDF, but the password protection wasn't allowing me to do so. Using Acrobat Pro (on mac), File --> Export to --> Microsoft Word. Then I was able go back in to Adobe and combine the files. If you're not needing to combine files, and just want a savable document, using Adobe Reader, File --> Convert to Microsoft, and then you can convert to PDF - have not tried this accessing the document after converted again though. Worth a shot.
 
This worked for me in 2024...if anyone is still looking. I do have Adobe Acrobat. Super fast and easy. As mentioned, you need the password to start, but then you can save it without in your files and access the document freely anytime. Great if you're sharing with colleagues or, in my case, uploading to a client database.
 
An excel file (.docx) was shared with me through dropbox. I WAS able to open it on my android phone. Then, we decided to have it password protected, so the owner added a password. Now, I can't open it on my android. In fact, when I try to open it, it crashes the Dropbox app. I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and the problem persists. What do I do?

I've tried opening it from the Dropbox app. It tries to open it (little blue progress bar along the bottom) and then crashes out of the app. (by "crashes" I mean the app completely closes and back to my phone's home screen. I've also tried sharing the link. In that case, when I try to open it on my phone it says "Couldn't load file. Check your internet connection. Try again" (My internet is connected, and I've tried cycling it on and off and that didn't help). Then it gives the option to "save to my dropbox", asks me to sign in again, and says "saved" . But when I try to open it it says, "The file can't be previewed. To open this file, try a computer or another app. " But there there's a little gray box at the bottom with a pencil in it. When I click that, It pops up "Open with..." and my choices are "Word, Docs, Polaris Office, Office Moblie, Send to Zoom Buddies". I pic Word, since it was made on word in the orignal on a computer. Then it opens. BUT, now it's a SAVED version, so I can't see new changes that are made on the original.

AutoCAD is a software developed by Autodesk that enables computer- aided design (CAD) and drafting. The software is used to produce 2D and 3D drawing. AutoCAD software allows users to conceptualize ideas, produce designs and drawings to the required levels of technical accuracy, and even perform rapid design calculations and simulations; across a wide range of industries.

AutoCAD was initially created for mechanical engineers, but very quickly extended to encompass a range of fields. In fact, AutoCAD's success is largely due to its mass adoption by a wide range of design professionals, including architects, project managers, animators and engineers.
 
Usually AutoCAD / other 2D drafting packages are mostly considered known to Engineering graduates. You either need to be good at AutoCAD or have good hand drawings skills. While it is not the job of most Engineering graduates to make detailed CAD drawings, they'd need a medium to express their draftsman. AutoCAD is here to the rescue.
 
If you are a diploma/ JE, and is employed in the design sector, then AutoCAD is a must. Knowledge of AutoCAD usually doesn't bring much value to your CV, but it does help you in your job life from simple drafts, presentations to detailed A1 and A0 diagrams.
 
When the education level is Certificate or Diploma, the average salary is of an AutoCAD Operator is 47,422 PKR per month. While someone with a Bachelor's Degree gets a salary 47% more than someone Certificate of Diploma. A Master's Degree gets its holder an average salary 15% more than someone with Bachelor's Degree.

Though gender should not have an effect on pay, in reality it does. So who gets paid more: men or women? 
Male AutoCAD Operator employees in Pakistan earn 16% more than their female counterparts.
 
AutoCAD Operator salaries in Pakistan are on the rise in the year 2019 based on recent submitted salaries and reports. Salaries in 2019 are 3% higher than those in 2018. The trend suggests a slow yet continuo's increase in pay 2020 and future years. These numbers differ slightly from industry to another.
 
We compared the salaries for AutoCAD Operator, Engineering and All Jobs and we found that AutoCAD Operator salaries are 18% less than those of Engineering. We also found that Engineering salaries are 11% less than those of All Jobs.
 
The main industry in which AutoCAD is used is construction. Autodesk Building Design Suite provides a 3D building design software portfolio that combines Building Information (BIM) and CAD tools to help construction engineers design, visualize, simulate and build more efficiently.
 
With an array of specialized toolsets integrated to form a modern, flexible graphic pipeline, the suite allows animators, visual effects artists and modelers to push the boundaries of their creative abilities, increase their productivity and meet tight deadlines.
 
AutoCAD 2020 software includes industry - specific toolsets; improved workflows across desktop, web, mobile and new features such as the Blocks palette. The specialized toolsets are AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD MEP, AutoCAD Plant 3D, AutoCAD Raster Design.


 
Hello, Dagovax and I have decided to continue work on the Star Wars Total War mod for Rome: Total War- it's been ported to the Alexander Expansion due to it being required in order to have heroes like Darth Vader in the campaign. 

The original creator of this mod, and the MODDB-page- SiskinEDGE -has also written to me that he liked the prospect of a completed SWTW-mod, and he created a new group for this mod, invited me and Dagovax as co-developers and gave us increased administrative rights on this page, while at the same time removing the rights for players to upload stuff freely. So SiskinEDGE said he were going to keep an eye out on the progress of this mod, and hence me and Dagovax are permitted to continue the work on this mod.

There existed an old mod with three releases from 2008-2009 made by SiskinEDGE- this version hadn't been updated since 2009 and used re-skinned Rome: Total War models of units. It only had infantry, but did however include Star Wars sound for blasters, a new UI, new loading screens based on the Prequel trilogy, Star Wars music from both the Prequel trilogy and the original trilogy. It had some custom battlemaps for the custom battles with a Star Wars theme, and it had good unit/unit\_info cards.

It lacked a campaign map completely, it didn't have new custom Star Wars themed banners, names for the factions, quotes and many animations were missing or lacking.

I previewed this mod for Dagovax Sirrianus, one of the main creators (two) of Total War: 1942, and he liked the idea of continuing this project. I had a bunch of Freedom Force models based on Star Wars, and Freedom Force is an old game from 2005- i gave him the idea to try and use them in Rome: Total War and provided him with these models. He succeeded in importing the Storm Trooper, and later other units as well- he had some issues with the spaceships and some mechs but after finding a way to use an older version of a modelling program he managed to find a way to import all the FF models to RTW. The original mod had been made for Rome: Total War- Dagovax moved it to the Alexander expansion. He did also create new banners for the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance and currently the Galactic Empire have quite the few units while the Rebel Alliance only has four. Dagovax also made new animations for the units, or ported animations that he had already created for the 1942 mod. New projectiles for the blasters, Deathstar, AT-AT etc have been created- even green laser bombs for the Tie Bombers. And he has created a custom campaign map based on Star Wars Galaxy- which is still lacking most of the settlements (to be planets).

I've uploaded a few WIP videos of the recent version that i'm going to show-off here, as they are simply too big for the video upload feature of MODDB. 


 
If you'd like Dagovax Sirrianus to continue the development of this mod, then comment on pictures, videos on his Youtubesite Youtube.com or on this site, on the Total War Center forum on this link Twcenter.net and simply show that you want this mod completed.

He have said that if there isn't enough interest in the project then he might end the development on it. And he is the only guy who can create new animations, new projectiles etc from scratch that i know is willing to do this work. There are other modellers, but he is the only active modder rigging models for this mod currently as well- needless to say without Dagovax Sirrianus the mod will die. So show him that you want the development to continue by commenting on this site etc.

We will probably get a Patreon up at a later stage where it will be posisble to support Dagovax by donating, something that will keep him working on the mod. Otherwise the risk is that the development might end, if there isn't enough interest in the project.

I don't have the skills to get a mod like this running, due to it being far too unfinished at it's current stage. Remember that all my mods had the models either made already, or i had a modeller who rigged them while i coded them into the mod. Dagovax is such a modeller, but he is so much more than that- without him the mod won't be continued at it's current stage. If the mod has all the models finished, and a map- then I would be able to continue work on it by myself. But in the current state that's impossible.

Message from Sirrianus Dagovax:

"Hello Patreons,

I am Sirrianus Dagovax, modder for some old games, and most of you might know me from the **Total War: 1942** and **Star Wars: Total War** modifications for Rome: Total War. 

You can be here because you have seen some of the youtube videos I uploaded, or some other YouTubers featuring my channel. I upload videos whenever I have new content to share, and the content is very different. But you will mostly see Rome: Total War modding stuff, which will provide a lot of things you never knew was even possible on this game engine.

But of course, all this new content costs a lot of time, and I would be very happy if you become my Patreon and support me so I will keep modding.

**Thank you**
If you are an existing Patreon then I would like to thank you for all your support, whatever the amount, you are making a difference and helping me further into this epic modding projects :)
 
Sirrianus Dagovax"

Link to his Patreon site where you can donate to Dagovax, in order to support him, if you want development on the Free Star Wars: Total War mod to continue uninterrupted:

Patreon.com
 
- It will allow your game RTW - Alexander to make use of more than 2gb of RAM-memory - it will decrease the risk of the game crashing in battle due to too much memory usage.

**CD/DVD:**
 
Place the SWTW-folder inside of your "Harddrive Location":\Game Folder\The Creative Assembly\Rome - Total War\alexander-folder using the CD - then move the Star Wars Total War.bat-file to the main Rome Total War directory and double-click it to start the mod.
 
The mod crashed when clicking "Start Campaign" on Steam, which I didn't know about - while it worked fine using the DVD/CD. If you have Alexander on STEAM you'd need to download this launcher by Dagovax Sirrianus and place it in the main Alexander folder.

Select a mod, change the wanted startup parameters, and launch the mod!
The launcher features a self-extracting method to fix the steam issue (where it can't load the mod), and swaps everything back when the game closes, so don't worry about losing any data.
 
**STAR WARS TOTAL WAR - a MOD first conceived and released by modder siskinEDGE between 2008-2009, later revived by me - Mr\_Nygren, and modder Dagovax Sirrianus in 2020 during the Pandemic- the mod has had 3 custom battle DEMO's since then where you could play as both the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, but it only had a map with 10 regions/sectors/planets and with no buildings, no balanced recruitment, no gameplay etc.. This is the first release adding a playable campaign - and possibly the last one too - You'd get a map with all 45 Planets of every movie, you'd get 3 factions - the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance and the "Neutrals" which is the slave-faction of RTW Alexander - everything has been polished to an extent where there are no vanilla rebel units, vanilla general portarits, heroes have been added for both main factions - 8 for each and everyone starts with 8 planets, costs and stats have been altered to be balanced between the factions - there are some new units!**
 
"Dagovax worked on adding placeholder planets to all his new regions, which he finished in December of 2021, and I've counted and there are 45 regions/settlements/planets in this mod - the Galactic Map is based on a picture of all the planets from the movies episode 1-8, Rogue One and Solo - 45 in total.
 
Including three unique battlefields - Hoth (The Snowy Planet of Episode V), Endor (The Forest Planet of Episode VI - Including Ewook Huts/Buildings) and Mustafar (The Volcano Planet where Anakin turned into Darth Vader).
 
I've added Neutral units to every planet after carefully checking out each planet in battle - they have varied garrisons now based on the most suitable troop-type. Unfortunately we're still limited to the units of the demo.
 
The recruitment = done, Buildings re-enabled = done, Wookie-Unit Description and name fixed, Diplomat cards fixed (Imperial Pilot is in use by both the Empire and the Neutrals, as for some reason the slave-faction/Neutrals share it with the Empire due to the culture,) & the Rebel Pilot for the Rebel Alliance. The Galactic Empire is also using the IG-88 Assasssin Droid card for their Assassin, and the Imperial Scouts for their spy - while the Rebel Alliance is using the Rebel Marksmen for their assassin (sharpshooters) and the "Rebel Scout Speeders" as their spy (Marksmen on Imperial Speeders - bot the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance are using the Galactic Empire strat-models on the map - the agents are all using the Imperial Shuttle.
 
All the regional area-of-recruitment-units like the TwiLek Rebels, the Gamorrean Guards (Green Pigs with axes), IG-88 Assassin Droids, Wookies and the Ewooks now spread out to every planet where they should be available for recruitment - the Neutral slave-faction can recruit all of them, and the Empire can recruit the IG-88 Assassin Droids and the Gamorrean Guards - while the Rebel Alliance can recruit the rest.
 
**The faction selection has been finished. So the map of the Neutrals have the enemy planets/sectors in red. The Neutrals are holding all the white areas on their map. For the others it's the red areas they're holding. The Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance do start with 8 planets each. This is out of a total of 45 planets, which means that 29 planets are held by the "Neutrals". Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker aren't the

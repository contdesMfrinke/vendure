Please tell me that I'm just being ignorant and there is an easy fix to this :(. Today I looked online and saw that theres a bunch of firmware updates for me to do on my lenses, E-510 body, and Ex-25. I opened Olympus Master and it prompted me to update (now running 2.11) and the software will not recognize my camera firmware information. 

When I select camera version information, it "connects with camera" but displays nothing in the dialogue box thing. The software doesn't tell me its having difficulty connecting to the E-510 either it seems to act as if it does connect but shows no information. Also when I try to update I get: "Failed to communicate with the server. (20)". I have removed all the cards, tried using just the body, switched the battery, used different lens, restarted the computer and nothing is working :(.

Does anyone know what the problem is?
Do I need to find an earlier version of Olympus Master, reinstall the current version, or am I SOL.

Thanks for any help, I tried to search for any other threads in this topic and couldn't find any.

Failed to communicate with server sounds like a general problem at Olympus. I've had that before... just too much traffic at their server. It will get better.

When you attempt to update your firmware, put your camera in "storage" mode... not auto. This is counterintuitive, but there it is.

Muzz I put it in storage... but not only is it not connected to Olympuses servers but the program wont recognize what type of camera/lenses I have attached of what firmware it has/

Oh. Did you try reinstalling Windows?

I'm sorry... bad joke. Maybe make sure you have the latest Master? I'm trying to get Master for my new computer but the Olympus servers seem smurfed.

Ohh yea, its the Mac version...

I'm also trying to get another version of olympus master to reinstall it. I just updated Olympus Master today and had no problems downloading and the servers seemed fine (did it about 5 min before trying to update firmware)... :S
If it is still not working in a little bit I guess I'll just wait and see if tomorrows better...

but if anyone knows if I'm making a mistake thats causing this problem, I'd like to know :)

Edit: I also just tried a ethernet cable connection instead of wirless seeing if that was the problem.... nope

Same problem here. So I guess the servers are just having problems... just why today? Its not like new firmwares have been released so there shouldn't be a plethora of people trying to access it. Maybe Olympus just happened to take their servers offline for upgrades/maintenance coincidently on the same day we are trying to do this.

I think it should, I cannot believe that it needs to contact the server to display it properly, but maybe I'm hoping that somehow it'll still be able to install and display the new firmware :S

It worked before when I updated from 1.0 to 1.2, so its not a hardware problem. Either something is wrong with the 1.2 firmware I installed or the Olympus Master software.

Mmm. Well, there's no way I'll be able to find the original CD after moving to a new city. I have boxes in my boxes still. I hope they get it sorted.

I don't remember there being a whole lot of updates for lenses... I think that was back in the E-1 era. But I could be mistaken.

Olympus Master on the Mac is horrible. There's a nasty authentication problem with OSX 10.5 that they seemingly haven't fixed. It also requires that you be logged in to an administrator account to use for program updates - it won't offer you an authentication login window to let you escalate privelages, as it should. (Most users are probably running as administrators anyway.) Actually, if I remember right, even being on an administrator account would give the "you must be an administrator" error.

My suggestion: try a different USB port on your computer and see if it makes a difference. If it doesn't, try another USB cable (if you have one).

@VoS, I tried different USB ports. I don't have another cable.

Update: I connected to the servers to download "templates" and it did not take long. I think my server problems are related to the inability of the software to determine my firmware and model. Olympus master is able to read the pics on the CF card so it doesn't seem to be having problems with the cable either.... I find this kind of stuff really agrivating.

Muzz, I think I may still have the CD for the orig. version, Ill go install it and see if it works after that. **EDIT** I have everything but the CD, just my luck.

It IS really horrible on the Mac. It requires a restart, for instance. There is no reason in the world why this should be true on OSX. Nothing but system software should \*require\* a restart. Lightroom. Aperture, Photoshop, etc don't even ask for a restart.

But anyway, it's what we've got. I guess I'll apply for the super secret download link again tomorrow.

Don't know if this will help you Grant but when I tried to update my 520 a while back, I followed the instructions (no card in etc) and it told me that I did not have a camera plugged in. So, after almost giving up, I formatted the memory card, put it in, and did the update. It found the camera and did the update without issue once I stopped following the instructions and left the CF card in... 

Well, almost, the camera showed the update done, and olympus master promptly crashed.

Why does Olympus do this to us? Downloading the updates and installing via CF card would be too easy. 

Oh wait, if they did that, then Olympus, like Canon, would have people writing hacks for the cameras and "improving" them and we couldn't have that now could we.

Meanwhile, instead of simply providing a link to Master, they insist on harvesting email address; so they'll email me the link "real soon now." Still waiting. And, they have gotten all my email address dozens of times by now.

None of that worked for me. I called Olympus America Customer Support, went through all the usual steps with them and nothing. They then wanted to reinstall Olympus Master 2.11, after which I said I tried to get it but the e-mail wouldn't send. So the customer service agent got the e-mail sent to me. The link is here:

emporium.olympus.com/downloads/XCMELOKJNMK/OM211EN.dmg

Muzz I hope you can access that without the e-mail. If you need the e-mail I'd just suggest calling Customer Support. 

Anyways just before I opened the e-mail my cable internet went down (I have my TV, phone, and internet all through cable) so the olympus customer support woman got cut off and I couldn't download the program to see if it works. Its finally back up, so I'm going to reinstall and see if the problem is fixed, if not I'll be calling customer support back.

Sooo frustrating :S

I just updated my E-500 and the update went ok.. ... well the program crashed, but the camera was updated and is fine. 

That olympus software is nasty .. its still running in the background and I can't kill it (even with task manager) 

this just goes to show that the mac version may not be as bad as you though.

Muzz, would you mind reporting back on whether the new firmware on the E-3 improved AF accuracy with the 50mm f2? its supposed to have added better accuracy with large aperture lenses.
ages ago(permalink)

 
I will, yes. Maybe this weekend I'll get to shoot. In the meantime, for E-3 owners, we now have the ability to select the focus point using the arrow keys as well as the scroll wheels. This should make Lenzflair happy. :)

By the way, reminder: all your base settings are belong to Olympus. When you update the firmware, you'll have to go through all the menus and reconfigure them back from the defaults to what you use.

I think all of us can agree with Muzz about buying Olympus for the cameras. In fact, I'd be happier to have no software at all really and just download a new installer for the firmware from olympuses site each time it needed updating.

Though I guess for the new cameras with novel RAW files that aren't read by programs like iphoto, aperture, lightroom, etc. the olympus master software is of a little more use.

There's something broken about registering the software... after reregistering the camera body (why?) it hangs at the invitation to Olympus Elite. Dunno why....

will it stop working if it's not registered?

Anyway, just looking at Master 2, it's really a lot nicer looking than Master 1.0 was. I think they're improving it.

I just registered lenses and filled out a questionaire, which is also supposed to give me that discount... but I don't remeber seeing anything like a code, etc. for it. Did I forget to click on something, just miss it, or is it tied into an account or something? Or do you not know ?

What about lens distortion correction? I finally installed OM2 yesterday to try it and it seems to work well. Neither DxO nor PTLens have Zuikos

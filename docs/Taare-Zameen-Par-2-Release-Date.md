After a short break from acting, Aamir Khan is all set to return to the big screen with his film, Sitaare Zameen Par, a spiritual sequel to his film Taare Zameen Par. Khan recently attended the screening of Kiran Rao's film Laapataa Ladies and shared new details about his next film. Aamir, who had been away from the screen since Laal Singh Chaddha, has now shared the release date of his upcoming film.
 
In a previous interview, Aamir had shared that the Sitaare Zameen Par and Taare Zameen Par will have no connection with each other and both the movies are standalone films. He said, "I have started shooting for my new film, Sitaare Zameen Par from February 1. It is the next level of Taare Zameen Par, it is like part 2. It is not the same story and the characters are also not the same."
 
During the social media interaction session, Aamir Khan shared exciting details from 'Sitaare Zameen Par' and said that the film is going to be released in the cinemas around the Christmas period. Talking in detail about the film, the superstar made a big revelation and said that Sitaare Zameen Par is a very entertaining film. Concluding the same, Aamir Khan added that if "The same amount that 'Taare Zameen Par' has made you cry, 'Sitaare Zameen Par' will make you laugh." Ever since Aamir announced Sitaare Zameen Par, the anticipation among the fans and the audiences to watch another exciting film from the superstar is at its high.

For the unversed, 2007's Taare Zameen Par tells the story of Ishaan Awasthi, a dyslexic kid who outshines and grows in life after his art teacher discovers his potential. Directed by Amole Gupta, the film also featured Tisca Chopra, Tanay Chheda, Vipin Sharma and Sachet Engineer among others. Darsheel Safary also won the Filmfare 2008 Best Actor Award for Taare Zameen Par.

Bollywood's Mr Pefectionist, Aamir Khan, is gearing up to work on his next film. It's being reported that the perfectionist of Bollywood has teamed up with director RS Prassana for a project, as per the Indian publication, Pinkvilla.
 
Spilling the beans about Sitaare Zameen Par, a source told the outlet, "The basic plot of the film is about a sports coach bonding with and training a team of specially-abled kids, much like Taare Zameen Par, which chronicled the journey of a teacher and a specially-abled student. The interpersonal relationships in the film and the evolution of lead characters are also very much like the cult classic, which led to Aamir and the team zeroing down on the title Sitaare Zameen Par."
 
Meanwhile, on the work front, Aamir was last seen in Laal Singh Chaddha. Directed by Advait Chandan and written by Atul Kulkarni, the film released on August 11, 2022. It marked Khan's reunion with Kareena Kapoor and Mona Singh after their 2009 film 3 Idiots.
 
Other than that, Khan recently announced a new project under his production house. The film, Lahore: 1947, will star Sunny Deol and will be helmed by Khan's Andaz Apna Apna director, Rajkumar Santoshi.

I was bought this book as a Christmas present. I just finished reading it this morning. I enjoyed it and found it interesting, but noticed a significant number of errors, particularly around people's ages.
 
Donna Hayward arrived in New York in 1992 (3 years after Laura's murder) aged 18. This means she would have been only 15 while in the same school year as Laura, who died aged 17 or 18, depending on whether you believe Mark's last book or the TV series.

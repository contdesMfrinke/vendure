It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January, and was given a limited theatrical release on July 22, 2011, by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film earned two nominations at the 38th Saturn Awards for Marling's performance and for Cahill and Marling's writing. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it slow paced but soulful.
 
Rhoda Williams, a brilliant 17-year-old girl who has spent her young life fascinated by astronomy, is delighted to learn that she has been accepted into MIT. She celebrates, drinking with friends, and in a reckless moment, drives home intoxicated. Listening to a story on the radio about a recently discovered Earth-like planet, she gazes out her car window at the stars and inadvertently hits a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs in a coma and killing his pregnant wife and young son. After serving her four-year prison sentence, Rhoda becomes a janitor at her former high school and struggles with guilt and regret.

One day Rhoda sees John laying a toy at the accident site. She visits his house, intending to apologize. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for a cleaning service. John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position, has been letting his home and himself go, and accepts Rhoda's offer. He has no idea who she is, and when she finishes asks her to come back the next week. In time, a caring relationship develops and they have sex.
 
Rhoda wins the essay contest and is chosen to be one of the first to travel to the other Earth. John asks her not to go, believing they might have a future together. She finally decides to tell him the truth about who she is. He is upset and throws her out of the house.
 
Rhoda hears an astrophysicist talking on television, describing a "broken mirror" hypothesis which states that upon the sighting of Earth 2 the synchronicity of events happening in both the Earths was broken. Rhoda rushes back to John's house, but he refuses to let her in. She breaks into his house, and he begins to strangle her. He stops, and when she recovers she tells him about the theory and that there might be a possibility for his family to still be alive on Earth 2 leaves him the ticket. In time, she learns that John accepted the gift and becomes one of the first civilian space travelers to Earth 2.
 
The idea behind *Another Earth* first developed out of director Mike Cahill and actress Brit Marling speculating as to what it would be like were one to encounter one's own self. In order to explore the possibility on a large scale, they devised the concept of a duplicate Earth. The visual representation of the duplicate planet was deliberately made to evoke the Moon, as Cahill was deeply inspired by the 1969 Apollo 11 lunar landing.[5] This movie shares some of its plot details with the 1969 British sci-fi movie *Doppelganger*.

According to Brit Marling, she approached William Mapother for the role of John after "being haunted" by his performance in *In the Bedroom* (2001). Mapother consented to work on *Another Earth* for $100 a day.[7] When asked why he agreed to join the cast, considering the "notoriously hit or miss" nature of independent films, Mapother replied that he was drawn by the film's subject and by the names involved in the project. At Mapother's insistence, he and the production team worked extensively on the scenes of John and Rhoda in order to develop John's character in the film.[8]
 
The film ignores the physical consequences of having a similar-sized planet and moon appear nearby (e.g. effect on tides, gravity and atmosphere) other than depicting night time as brighter due to the reflection of the Sun's light off the other planet. The DVD / Blu-ray deleted scenes feature reveals that the film makers did intend to illustrate some of the consequences by filming a scene in which Rhoda encounters flowers floating in mid-air, but the scene was cut from the final film.
 
The musical score was composed by Fall on Your Sword, with the exception of the song played in the musical saw scene, composed by Scott Munson and performed by Natalia Paruz.[9] Mike Cahill came upon Paruz, known also as the "Saw Lady", while riding the subway in New York. Mesmerized by her playing, he obtained her contact information and arranged for her to coach William Mapother on how to hold and act as if playing the saw for the scene in the film.[5][10]
 
*Another Earth* had its world premiere at the 27th Sundance Film Festival in January 2011. It was released in dramatic competition. *Variety* reported: "[It] has been deemed one of the more highly praised pics of the fest as it received a standing ovation after the screening and strong word of mouth from buyers and festgoers." The distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures won distribution rights to the film in a deal worth $1.5 million to $2 million, beating out other distributors including Focus Features and the Weinstein Company.[11]
 
Fox Searchlight is the distributor of *Another Earth* in the United States, Canada, and other English-speaking territories.[11] The film had a limited release in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2011, expanding to a wide release in ensuing months.[12]
 
Rotten Tomatoes gives *Another Earth* a rating of 66% based on 134 reviews and an average score of 6.3/10. The critical consensus reads: "*Another Earth* is often weighed down by placid pacing and ponderousness, but this soulful sci-fi nevertheless offers plenty of profound concepts to ponder."[14]
 
Film critic Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three and a half stars out of four. Ebert commented that, "*Another Earth* is as thought-provoking, in a less profound way, as Tarkovsky's *Solaris*, another film about a sort of parallel Earth".[15]
 
*Another Earth* won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, for "focusing on science or technology as a theme, or depicting a scientist, engineer or mathematician as a major character."[16] It went on to earn the Audience Award in the category of Narrative Feature at the 2011 Maui Film Festival.[17][18]
 
*Another Earth* was named one of the top 10 independent films of the year at the 2011 National Board of Review Awards and was nominated for a Georgia Film Critics Association Award for Best Picture.
 
send the "other" Rhoda back so that our Rhoda could see what she would have become if she hadn't gotten in the accident, and had gone to MIT? Did John send the other Rhoda back to torture our Rhoda?
 
I don't think that John sent the other Rhoda back to meet 'our' Rhoda. The two Earths' histories diverged when they both observed the other Earth. At the moment of divergence, 'our' Rhoda was distracted by the other Earth and got into the crash. If this hadn't happened, she would have gone off to MIT to study the stars, just as communications with the other Earth were opening up and the expeditions from each Earth were being planned.
 
Rhoda was going to go to MIT, and she had a passion for astronomy. Had she not been in the accident, she would have been a natural candidate for heading to the other Earth. I've always assumed this is what occurred, and that we are seeing the alternate, successful Rhoda at the end of the film. This fits in with the movie's theme of the other Earth representing duplicate alternates of all of us who lived slightly different lives for the past few years.
 
Another option is that it's entirely plausible that on both Earths the Rhodas submitted winning essays to attempt to be on the trip to the other Earth. Only due to the tragedy that she caused did 'our' Rhoda stay on her Earth.
 
Rhoda hears in a telecast the citizens of the mirror Earth were identical to those on her Earth in every way until the moment they learned of the others' existence. From that point on, the identical people on the different Earths probably began to deviate in small ways, changing their actions. **Rhoda hopes her identical self on the other Earth did not make the mistakes she made on the night of the accident.**
 
The Rhoda waiting on the driveway is the Rhoda we have watched throughout the film, who has followed through with visiting herself. I do not accept that the Rhoda we watched through the film transferred her ticket to John. (As if she could exercise control over who went?) On Earth 1, Rhoda is the ticket winner; on Earth 2, John is the ticket winner.
 
Yes, it's most likely that Rhoda of Earth 2 has come because of John from Earth 1.This is clearly not a case of John from Earth 1 and Rhoda from Earth 2 crisscrossing and landing up in their "other" Earth in the same time frame.
 
How far does that put the two Earths? Not very far. In and around the distance of the moon. It takes 3-4 days to get to the moon from Earth - this is for a manned mission. Let's triple the time, that would make 12 days, about 2 weeks. 2 weeks is how long it would take to reach the other Earth.
 
Rhoda of Earth 1 and Rhoda of Earth 2 run into each other after months and not weeks. That removes the possibility that Rhoda of Earth 2 and John from Earth 1 leave their respective planets at the same time. Rhoda of Earth 2 arrives much after John of Earth 1 reaches Earth 2.
 
Hence it is more likely that John's landing on Earth-2 lead to Rhoda of Earth-2 getting to know the story of the accident and influenced her to come to Earth 1. If not for John's story, Rhoda on Earth 2 would be one among thousands of MIT (assuming the accident doesn't happen) and other top university students enthusiastic to travel to the other Earth. Not enough to be picke

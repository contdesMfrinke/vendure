The Blob Brush tool will not aways 'blob' with a shape (merge with it) even when all the properties are matching and correct (same color and no fill). I will make a shape with a solid fill and no stroke. I will select the Blog Brush tool to paint over it with the same color and it won't merge with the shape as it should. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I have tried turning off GPU to see if that helps, but it doesn't. I have never had this problem before.

The only thing that I have noticed is that when a shape is first created with no stroke and a solid fill and I immedately use the Blog Brush it seems to work everytime. However, if I have existing shape with a fill and and stroke and turn the stroke off in order to use it with the blob brush tool it is more likely that it won't work (even though the fill color matches with the Blob Brush color). It's as though the Blob Brush tool is still seeing the original shape attributes even though the Properties panel and elsewhere clearly show that the stroke is off. This is not even consistent though.
 
I have found this random merging VERY frustrating. And since I do a lot of lettering, I can't just draw off to the side. I use Illustrator instead of Photoshop for the purpose of keeping all the little strokes separate for easier manipulation, but half the time I find that the strokes are suddenly merged together even when I specifically keep that function turned off. Older versions of Illustrator never had this problem and I REALLY wish Adobe would fix this.
 
I have a problem with illustrator. All of the sudden my brush and pencil tool icon disappeared from the toolbar. I also can't activate them by using the keynote (b). I reset the workspace setting, quit en restarted illustrator and I'm certainly not in capslock mode. I can see the brushes menu though but by clicking on one of the options my pointer won't change. Where did it go??

Every time I change the pen tool to basic .25 thickness and go to click on artboard, it switches back to calligraphy 1pt. And yes, I have the appearance thing clicked OFF. I have the newest version of Ai. This was also happening with the older versions, and when I initially upgraded to this version, this problem was fixed. It was great! But alas, the problem is back and is driving me absolutely CRAAAZY! Please help!!
 
Hopefully I can help somebody with this. I had this issue myself, and I found ALL sources of info on this were not even coming close to understanding the problem, much less addressing it. So I went and screwed around with Illustrator and my Gaoman tablet (very excellent tablet for $100 that's as good as a Wacom Cintiq, btw.) Anyhow, it turns out my solution was this -

When I select the Paintbrush Tool from the left tool bar, I then go up and select stroke properties, stroke weight, and brush profile, if any. My next natural step is to go pick my stroke and fill colors. The problem is, I do that, and my brush seems to reset just as soon as I click on the canvas to begin drawing a stroke. For me, THIS IS BECAUSE THE DROPDOWN MENU IS NOT WHERE YOU SELECT THE COLOR! So, when I click on the swatch in the drop down, and I go straight to the canvas, I haven't actually selected anything. You have to click on the little box for color, select the color from the drop-down, AND THEN select the color up there in the fill or stroke box AGAIN, to actually select the color. What that means is the drop-down menus are for FINDING colors and things, but in order to actually select them you have to click once again in the little box that brought you the drop-down to begin with. THAT is selecting color, etc. Try this. It worked for me. Those drop-downs are not selecters, they're finders in the library only. To select, click that little box in the toolbar a second time, AFTER you have picked your color from the library. Only then go to the canvas. Worked for me. Hope it helps.

I would suppose the Adobe staff all take for granted the way the Illustrator menus work. They don't work that way in Photoshop, and it's hard to see why not, but they don't. I know for myself personally that I work with LOTS of graphics programs for various things, and it had been a long, long time since I used Illustrator last. I too came back to Illustrator expecting it to work like Photoshop. That's really all the confusion, if you ask me.

2. I drew two shapes once with the Pencil and once with the Paintbrush. It seems like after drawing with both tools, that I have access to the same options in the Control Panel for chaning the stroke size, variable width profile, and brush definition, essentially making the end result from the two different tools the same. What are the main differences or reasons to use the Pencil vs. the Paintbrush?
 
Probably personal preference and whatever the project calls for. I like using the Pencil tool when I want somewhat a hand drawn look. The Pen tool is more accurate and technical. Problem I find is the Pencil tool leaves you with a lot of extra anchor points. The Brush tool is pretty close to the Pencil tool with a few extra options.
 
There are reasons youyu might use the paint brush and the pencil tool rather than the pen tool and experience will tell you when the pen tool is simply more versatile and accurate so it has more usage but say you wnted to fill an object with a brush like texture like such the brush tool will work much better than the pen tool. Circumstances usually dictate which tool is best.
 
They all create paths that when viewed in outline view look the same. The pen and pencil tools are two different ways to create the same thing. With the pen you manually put the points and control the shape of the curves with handles. With the pencil you draw like using a real life pencil and based on your movements and speed Illustrator adds the points automatically and creates the shape of the curves according to parameters that you can set in the options of the tool. You can start creating a path with one tool and continue drawing or editing the path with the other tool. Also the Smooth and Path Eraser tools under the Pencil group in the tool box are basically the pencil tool in special mode.
 
Another way to create variable width stroke is using the Width tool which can be used on paths without pressure sensitive input. The appearance created with the Width tool can be edited and reused on other paths using the Profile menu in the Stroke panel.
 
Illustrator's Paintbrush Tool (B) and Brush Panel are some of its most powerful tools. With the Paintbrush Tool (B) and Brush Panel, you can dress up your vector paths into compelling flourishes, patterns, tapered edges, and more.
 
The difference is that Illustrator's **Paintbrush Tool (B)** applies predefined vector art to the paths you create. This might seem like a simple distinction, but using brushes will greatly improve your Illustrator productivity and helps you create artwork you never thought possible. There are five Illustrator brush options:
 
The **Scatter Brush**in Illustrator****will define paintbrush vector art as a brush. The **Scatter Brush** will then scatter copies of the art across a path when applied to a path.
 
Illustrator already has several preset Calligraphic Brushes, but you can use the following steps to create a new **Calligraphic Brush**. Unless you are working with a tablet, don't change the settings for the variations from the dropdown menus.
 
**Roundness**: Entering a lower number than 100% will produce a flatter brush. Setting the **Variation** to **Random** with a high value will create more variation in the roundness of the brush.
 
**Size:**Use the slider to define a **Fixed** or **Random** size for the scatter brush elements in relation to the original shape. If you want to define a random size, select **Random** from the drop-down menu. Use the two variation sliders to specify the range within which the brush size will vary.
 
**Spacing:**Use the slider to define a **Fixed** or **Random** amount of spacing between instances. If you want to define a random amount of space, select **Random** from the drop-down menu. Use the two variation sliders to specify the range within which the spacing between instances will vary.
 
**Hue Shift:**Set a key color for the brush. By default, the most prominent color in the brush is set to be the key color. To change the key color, click the eyedropper icon, and click the color that you want to be set as the key color from the brush preview in the **Brush Options** window. The sections from the brush that use the key color will be replaced with the stroke color. Other colors in the brush artwork become colors related to the stroke color. Black, white, and gray do not change.
 
**Brush Scale Options:** Set the scale settings for an art brush. With the **Stretch Between Guides** setting, you can use the two guides in the brush preview window to set the portion of the brush that should stretch when you apply the brush on a path.
 
**Direction:**This setting sets the orientation of the brush in relation to the path to which the brush is applied. Select one of the four arrows to change this option. The blue arrow that appears in the preview window allows you to see how the art will be drawn on a path.
 
Pattern brushes are arguably the most difficult to master. A **Pattern Brush** can consist of up to five different pattern swatches. You can use different artwork for the start, finish, side (center), inside corner, and outside corner. Creating a **Pattern Brush** with fi

On August 1, 2023, First Circuit Court Judge Lisa W. Cataldo filed the order approving the settlement. After the appeal period expires on or about September 1, 2023, Settlement Payments will begin to be disbursed to living Class Members.
 
Our hearts go out to our class members and their families on Maui. If you have been displaced or are in a temporary location, please contact the Claims Administrator with updated contact information. Please email [email protected] or call 808-650-5551 or 1-833-639-1308.
 
The Probate Special Master and Probate Special Counsel will work with the Claims Administrator and family members to collect the information and documentation to identify the rightful heirs and devisees and to process the probate petitions. If you have not already done so, family members should complete a Deceased Information Request Form available at www.kalima-lawsuit.com.

Settlement checks have now been mailed to approximately 1,300 living Class Members. Settlement checks must be cashed within 120 days after issuance. In most cases, the checks must be cashed by March 20, 2024. Please cash your check by that date.
 
This process is expected to take about two years to complete. Estates of Deceased Class Members with the most accurate and complete information about possible heirs will be processed first. Those with incomplete information will take longer.
 
A notice about the Probate Plan was mailed out by the Claims Administrator on Dec. 4, 2023, and contains detailed information about how the Probate Plan will work. Relatives of Deceased Class Members who have not already done so, should submit a Deceased Class Member Information Form and Family Information Form. Both can be found at the Kalima website www.kalima-lawsuit.com. It is critical that these forms be completed and submitted to the Claims Administrator to facilitate prompt distributions.

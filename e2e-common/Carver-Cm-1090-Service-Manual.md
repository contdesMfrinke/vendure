For a couple of years, I have been looking for a replacement for my Toshiba DVD Recorder that was starting to break down. I had placed four orders with Amazon....3 of the recorders did not work and had to be returned, the fourth order was canceled by the seller before shipping with no explanation. An internet search brought me to spencertified.com and I found a refurbished Toshiba recorder similar to the one I was using. Without high expectations, I placed another order with them. SpenCertified let me know when my order was placed and kept me fully updated during the shipping process. The recorder arrived in about 4 days (much quicker than I anticipated) and works perfectly. The box included the recorder, remote and users' manual and advertised. I am very satisfied with my experience with SpenCertified and plan to order additional equipment from them. I highly recommend them.

I was totally amazed with the speed of delivery for my order. Ordered on May 4 and received on May 8! It was very thoughtful of them to email me to offer assistance and to ensure I was happy with my purchase. Great Job!
 
Being a senior who refuses to give up VCR'S, I was in a panic because my last one died and no one sells them anymore in CA. Luckily I discovered SpenCertified, and will never have to worry again. I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am with the fantastic service they provide. My sets arrived in a timely manner, extremely well wrapped and the friendly emails offering any help were appreciated. I will continue to do business with them in the future and plan to refer them to all my friends. Thank you, guys... YOU CAN BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.
 
When my beloved VCR died, I discovered new ones were not being manufactured as before. All my tapes, collected over many years - - lost!? All future recordings - - lost!? What to do? Then, I discovered SpenCertified. I was wary. Was this a scam? I was afraid. Would my purchase truly be guaranteed? I wanted, I NEEDED, a working VCR, so I made my order. The packaging was perfect, the VCR was even better than advertised, Spencer was extremely helpful. I am a very satisfied customer.
 
I just got my vhs dvd player in the mail. I was so impressed how well they kept me informed about it. When i got it it was well packaged no problems. We hooked it up and works great. Thank you so much will do buisness again.

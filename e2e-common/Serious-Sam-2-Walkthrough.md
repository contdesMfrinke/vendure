Hey,   
After seeing tons of questions in the comment section of ''Dangerous Adventure 2'', I wanted to create some kind of guide, and I hope the community on Armor Games will help me complete it. I must say that I only did 43% of the game (EDIT : 104% at the moment), however I do hope that people who have finished the game will come here and help me complete the walkthrough. Also, this guide (At least at the beginning) will depict my view of the game. Finally, some points won't be covered (Either because I forgot about them or because I do not have enough information, feel free to HELP in the comments below and me or an Admin will add the information :-)   
EDIT : Nearly finished the game at the moment (august 28th) All that is left is the tower, at the moment I'm at the 70th floor.

-Do NOT hesitate to farm, to cook, and buy SMALL potions (HP/MANA), small potion = best ratio (More details in the guide) Its better to use 10 mana potions of 50 mana, and some health potions, and beat easily the group of enemy, than losing, being kicked out of the map and having to do it all again, right ? Also, a method is explained on how to use the potions easily (Attack a group, use the potions, then run (More details in the guide)
 
-Choose wisely your heroes and cards, they are VERY important and sometimes, 1 damage or 1 more hp makes you win the battle. Hell, sometimes you win while you also die (Happened to me once, if this happens, don't bother to continue the map, just exit and come back (When I tried to continue and attacked another enemy group, my health was : ''Dead skull symbol'' ''Dead Skull symbol'' 3 8 . Wtf ? xD In other words, guard an eye on your hp, and hope to not encounter such a bug...
 
INTERESTING LIMITS IN THE GAME -->  
Each time you fight a random enemy and win, you win some upgrade for one of your cards.  
It seems that spells/skills cards are limited to level 5, but that there are no limits for weapons/armor cards (However, the higher the level, the harder it is to upgrade them. Someone tested this : (Credits goes to player ''Hyruu89'') -->

(Taken from the game's description : ''Build and level a team of heroes each with their own unique skills that will help you navigate the levels. Match colored stones in battle to cause damage and gain mana. Collect items, equipment and spells to help you discover all of the secrets of the land!'')
 
What is the point of this game ? Its about becoming a legend with your group of heroes. Which the old man in the tavern noticed and will greatly help you, even if his intentions may not be fully revealed ... What makes a legend ? Doing incredible things, such as slaying wolfs, bears, skeletons, orcs, dragons ... But also by finding special & rare objects through your adventure. From a flight potion to a hand of a demon, you will need these objects to progress, and some are more important than others.
 
So, from what I've seen, we can create 2 different ''Teams''. Either a ''Discovery Party'' (Mainly, Heroes taken are here to help advance and beat the monsters) and a ''Progress & Money Party'' (Farming team if you prefer) (Mainly, Heroes chosen are here to make you win more experience, help you find some objects (Ingredients for exemple (We'll talk about them later)) more easily ...
 
**Bard** (Blue slot, will give a +10% loot from each battle, very useful) + Monk (Will make you give + 10% experience for each battle) + **Barbarian OR Paladin** (In my opinion, up to you to choose, but maybe you will need the Barbarian more (Rare in my opinion that you must heal a Character (Character not being a Hero from your party I mean) + Druid (Green slot) Will higher your chances to find ingredients (Again, we'll talk about them later)) and Finally, the Thief.   
As you may have noticed, you may put the druid in the Blue Slot and the Bard in the purple slot, up to you to decide. If you do so, then the green slot will be free = In other words, you will have to take the Hunter and NOT the Thief character, Hunter which is able to find secret paths, while the thief can pick locks and some mechanisms... in other ways, its the level that you will choose that should influence this decision.
 
**ALSO[/B] The equipment has a lot of impact of course but as they level up the differences are really noticeable too. I have heroes at level 14 only and theres differences as big as 60-70 % on mana generation without having equipment in account. SO it really affects how your combat strategy plays out. Attack and health seem more homogenous though. Theres differences too in attack and health but usually below 5 points so equipments seems to decide more this aspect.**
 
For example one reason I like the Paladin is it has great balanced stats (among the best health and damage while still having good mana generation) and the heal between combats is indeed very useful while completing levels. The monk helps Leveling up a bit faster. That is nice too but that doesnt help in completion really, wisdom of the forest gives a lot more extra xp than that perk, and I feel I would need more potions to compensate for not having a paladin. So in this case for me the decision would come down to if I want more yellow mana or I prefer more balance. (Credits to player ''Jervai'')  
Conclusion : The characters have inner stats that makes them even more different while growing with levels.
 
Nothing too big, only a few points but its seems to start been noticeable on battle. Specially when you do big combos. Druid would seem the less damaging with Bard and Monk been likelly on the middle after Paladin. But take these 3 with a grain of salt as its mainly specualtion.
 
Another thing to note is that equipment of every colour, although providing options for different builds, seems to favorise some stats making the differences more extreme and noticeable.  
Blue seems to favour Mana, Yellow seems balanced not really bad on anything but good on mana, red favours damage and to lesser extent hp, green is like yellow but less mana and purple seems to favour damage.
 
The differences on equipment arent too great either due to having a few options for each colours that let youd ecide and tailor what you want more, but it does give an extra flexibility for double colours.
 
'''Not all gear is created equal  
There's basically 3 stats: Attack(wpn only), energy gain(seems semi-multiplicative between two gear pieces), and hp(armor only). You'd think that the game is all about tradeoffs, and that's partially true. But, some gear is strictly better than others. Some gear costs 800 g to upgrade; others cost 500. In general, the 500s are worse pieces of gear, with some being entirely outclassed. Be careful which resources you invest into. There's 3 pieces of gear for each color/slot.
 
About the Shield mechanic:  
(Credits goes to play ''StairWalker'' -->   
'''''''''''''''''''After some more tests, I've figured out how shields work. What the shield skill does is creating a barrier of the color on the shield, and you have to completely destroy it until the enemy can be damaged by regular attacks. For example:  
A Red Croc Guard normally takes full damage from Red, half damage from Blue/Yellow and none from Purple/Green. When it uses a Purple shield with a strength of 80, Red/Yellow will be useless because Purple takes no damage from these colors. But Purple does full damage and Green/Blue do half damage to the shield until 80 points of damage is dealt. Then the shield is gone (Any extra damage over 80 will be wasted) and the Croc Guard can be damaged normally.
 
Things that hit through shields are tamed monster, direct/active damaging skills, poison and bleeding because the damage they do is independent of the enemy's color.''''''''''''''''''' (Abilities = spells (Cards) that you will discover/use in the game.
 
There are many levels in this game, one of the reasons why it isn't the kind of game that you finish in 10 minutes ^^   
EACH level will be important in some way, either because it has some special units/characters or because you will find there ingredients that you won't find in a lot of other levels ... Also, from what I've seen, some levels (While searching) will give you some ''objects''. A typical example : You will find 2 keys in the first level, the 3rd one will be either in the 5th level or the 6th level. In all cases, you will need those 3 keys to open a door in the caban that is located in the first level. In other words, sometimes you'll have to come back in certain levels/areas to advance in the game.
 
The Kitchen (Which you will be able to visit after you finish the 3rd level and coming back with the frog's leg) will help you create ''plates'', you will also be able to buy plates from the barman, sell plates to the gourmet that is sitting in the tavern and you will be able to sell ingredients to the woman that is located inside the kitchen. Making plates is important. First of all, its a way to make money (Selling...) but also a way to make your heroes more powerful (You can equip a hero with a plate (Click on ''Charlist'' --> Food Icon (Near Cards and Chest icon, on the right side of the screen--> Drag the plates to the allocated area (Inder your hero's weapon slot) The plate will be useful for a certain number of battles (Some will work for 1 battle, some for 3-4 battles ... I guess it depends of the plate's quality, but also of the plate itself)   
About the ingredients, in general at the end of a battle some monsters will give you Ingredients, they will be used to create the plates. Some of them are more common, and some of them are very rare... In all cases, you will need some ingredients to unlock recipes from some characters in the game (Such as the goblin that you will heal in level 1, after you had found the 3 keys to open the door, goblin that will

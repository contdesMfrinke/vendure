User has a physical body/form made up of blessings. As such, being blessed is the same as breathing or having a heartbeat to them, trying to remove the user's blessing would be the same as killing them.

This summer an unexpected change occurred. My son, who a few years earlier would barely brush his teeth or comb his hair, suddenly seemed to discover himself in the mirror. Almost overnight he decided that how he looked mattered. He started to try different hairstyles, and spent hours combing and spraying his locks this way and that. He decided to get fit and strong, waking up early each morning to ride his bike to the community center to work out and swim. He turned 13 in January and, apparently, transformed into a young man by June.
 
For me, on the other hand, a lifetime was more like 47 years. Yet, even though so many years had passed, our conversation quickly took me back to the memory of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror at 13 years old.
 
Sara, what beautiful wisdom! Trying to grow old gracefully is a challenge. I do not think that my perception of my pregnant body included strong. Thank you for sharing. And, it is comforting to know that teenagers can suddenly make it a priority to take good care of their health and a little effort in how they present themselves.
 
Amazing! So true, what a unique perspective. Your ability to express yourself and put it into words is beautiful. I had a few laughs along the way too ??? I might need some help with future essays, Tia ?
 
A few months ago, I purchased an activity tracker (or what I like to call my "fancy pedometer"). Before I started using this little contraption, I mistakenly believed that I was a reasonably active person. Unfortunately, as it began to track my every move, I had to face the fact that my life had become sedentary. On normal workdays, I took less than 5,000 steps from morning to night -- in other words, I barely moved. My weekly workout with the trainer was not enough to counteract my inactive lifestyle. I knew I had to make some changes.
 
As my walks became more frequent, I discovered an added benefit -- walking is an excellent way to unplug.
 
Rather than plugging in the headphones, I use the time to clear my head. I can process problems that have been bothering me, pray and visualize, or simply observe the world and reflect on my life.
 
Another focus for a nice long walk is gratitude. Gratitude is a powerful spiritual practice, and it never fails to increase our sense of well-being. Through praise and gratitude, we shift our focus from lack to fulfillment. Taking the focus off our troubles, we place it on what is working and what brings us joy. Gratitude increases our awareness of how blessed we are and helps us let go of worry and complaint.
 
I recently turned 47, so my feet have supported me for nearly five decades. They have carried me (and some extra pounds) countless miles with minimal complaint. As I thought about how long and far my feet have traveled, I knew I hadn't thanked them enough. So I stretched my feet from toe to heel. I thanked them and blessed them for all their hard work.
 
I moved on and blessed my thighs for their strength, my hips for their flexibility, my back and my core for their stability. Focusing positive attention on these parts of my body made me feel stronger, and I noticed I was walking a little faster.
 
As I worked through my body blessing, I took an extra moment with my lungs. I have asthma. So I paused to consider this part of my body and how my breathing can sometimes be uncomfortable. Yet even with occasional discomfort, I am blessed with life-giving breath every minute of every day. My lungs deserve praise and appreciation for their vital function and continual health and healing.
 
Rather than lament any weakness or sickness, praise the troubled spots for the health they exhibit. When we bless our bodies, we raise our thoughts right out of unhealthiness, into an experience of well-being. Our minds, bodies and spirits thrive with praise.
 
**Praise every bit.** Every part of our bodies deserves a little attention. How often do we even think about our elbows? And yet, I wouldn't want to imagine life without them! As we continue through our body blessing, be grateful for every bit.
 
As I walked, I blessed my arms, hands, shoulders, neck, head, eyes and ears. I felt the energy of that blessing immediately. My arms pumped with a little more gusto, my shoulders straightened, my posture improved. I was aware of the energy of life flowing through my body and it felt great!
 
**Unoma Azuah**: I work on every genre of literature from fiction to poetry, non-fiction and drama. I do work more on some than the others. My dominant focus, for instance, is mostly fiction and poetry. Recently though, I compiled a non-fiction anthology called Blessed Body: The Secret Lives of LGBT Nigerians. Of all the genres, I enjoy poetry the most. It gives me a space to condense my words and say a lot in a very limited space. It challenges me to utilize figures of speech, imagery and mood to capture my thought and ideas. I also like non-fiction because there is urgency about it. It almost feels as if I am documenting narratives live, as they happen. At the moment, I am working on a critical paper about how films/documentaries can be used as an effective tool of activism for the African LGBTQ activist. Additionally, I am editing and polishing my second collection of poetry collection entitled Brutal Bliss.
 
**UA**: Since the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act was enacted a lot has changed both on the positive and the negative sides. The SSMPA has created an atmosphere where homophobia and jungle justice have basically been sanctioned as the law of the land. In other words, anybody can take advantage of that law to intimidate, exhort, blackmail and even kill members of the LGBT community in Nigeria. We are further driven underground and are denied legal recourse. For instance, there were quite a number of cases where violent attacks of LGBTQ persons started after the signing of this Bill. Some men and women rumored to be gay disappeared without a trace. Because family members of such a gay man would be stigmatized if they attempt to investigate such cases, such deaths were and are still not being reported or investigated. As if that was not terrible enough, when human rights bodies around the world condemned the act, it seemed to have made the situation worse. It escalated the attacks and worsened LGBTQ persecutions. However, despite all these confining and punitive measures because of the anti-gay law, the Nigerian LGBT community continues to fight and defy the tyrannical grip of hate. One outlet of the Nigerian LGBT defiance to counter oppressive laws is through writing. The online magazine, Nigerians Talk dedicated its first issue on a gay theme in response to the anti-same sex marriage prohibition act. This edition of the e-zine was launched a few weeks after the bill was signed into law. That to me is a highly positive development. There seems to be an explosion of online queer writing particularly with the recent release of the Nigerian queer e-zine called 14: We are flowers. Their use of the number 14 speaks to the appalling 14 years jail term for homosexuals in Nigeria. There is no going back. I expect a flood of gay-themed literature, thanks to the ignorant law.

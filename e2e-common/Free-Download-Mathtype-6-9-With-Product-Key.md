MathType is a non-web application that allows users to create equation images in several formats. When integrated with Microsoft Word, it also allows creating web content containing equation images from a Word document. In consequence, requirements labeled in the standards included in this report as "Software" or "Authoring tool" apply to MathType
 
In order to ease the reading of this report, each cell in the column "Conformance Level" and "Remarks and Explanations" is divided in three rows, corresponding to the three scopes of applicable requirements: "Software", "Authoring tool" and "Support Docs".

Requirements related to "Web", "Closed Functionality Software", "non-web document" or "Product Docs" don't apply because MathType is not a web application, it is not a closed functionality software, and all its documentation is web.
 
The following article assumes the MathType integrations architecture. We encourage you to grasp the architecture to properly understand the Frontend and Services notation and choose the appropriate deployment to satisfy your needs.
 
This option is useful when loading the rich text editor from a CDN or when you want to have the editor directory separate from your custom integrations. In case you are using a programing language for which MathType Integrations are not available this is also a good option.
 
You can install MathType integration as an external integration and TinyMCE. Using this option you do not need to install any component on your servers. You only need to add the following line to your TinyMCE configuration.
 
Unzip the tinyMCE MathType integration and copy the tiny\_mce\_wiris directory into your tinyMCE plugins directory. For example, you will have tiny\_mce/plugins/tiny\_mce\_wiris. The name of the MathType integration directory must be tiny\_mce\_wiris.
 
Give write permissions to pluginwiris\_engine/cache and to pluginwiris\_engine/formulas directories to the web server user. Those folders will be used to store formula MathML codes and temporal images. If you prefer, you can configure the location of these folders .
 
Give write permissions to ckeditor/plugins/ckeditor\_wiris/cache and to ckeditor/plugins/ckeditor\_wiris/formulas directories to the web server user. Those folders will be used to store formula MathML codes and temporal images. If you prefer, you can configure the location of these folders.
 
The parameters used when creating formulas (font color, background color, transparency...) are defined in the configuration.ini file. However, it is possible, in specific cases, that these values must be overriden at runtime or that there must be two editors with different configurations running at once.
 
The quality of the only workaround they provided to us was so low that it was not of any practical use, and the company has since put most of their efforts into being more of an add-on maker for MS Word.
 
We gave them a few years, but when they then dropped all Mac development of their dedicated client leaving users on modern systems with no way to run it any more, there was very little reason for us to continue having the menu command. We had only kept on to it, poor quality as it was, because it was something the Mac provided still (where there, they did provide vector data).
 
Hello, does anyone have a solution for using "MathType" with Indesign,
I have big font problem in formulas, sometimes the character disappears PDF creation or when we ask for a "Display of superior quality."

My idea is that information is too basic in import in InDesign and can not read and insert adquoite police.
 
You've left out a critical part of the picture, and that is how you're getting the equations from MathType into InDesign. One thing that may have a bearing on this issue is that I recently learned that when you start with a Word+MathType document and place it into InDesign, the MathType equations are converted into EPS with
 
You've left out a critical part of the picture, and that is how you're getting the equations from MathType into InDesign. One thing that may have a bearing on this issue is that I recently learned that when you start with a Word+MathType document and place it into InDesign, the MathType equations are converted into EPS with WMF preview (if you're on Windows). If you convert the problem equations to EPS/none, many if not all of the problems go away -- at least they did in the document I was working with.
 
If you'd like to provide a sample document, either by attaching it here or sending a link to a cloud folder, I'll take a look. If you're going from Word to ID, send the Word document as well as the .indd document.
 
There are a few hoops to jump through, but it seems one of the critical elements is unembedding and linking the images as described in the article. Even then, sometimes the equations can't be edited. I've had more success on Windows, but on the Mac, crazy as it may seem, the least problematic workflow is Word 2008+MathType 6.7e, saved as .doc.
 
we're trying to work out our workflow with Word 2010+ MathType 6.7 (through 6.9)+ InDesign/InCopy CS6. We've been embedding MathType in the past, and are now considering placing each MathType to prevent random characters from disappearing.
 
Our results are much better with linked/placed MathType EPS/none objects than with embedded objects, but we're still seeing characters disappear. It's a big step for us to change our MathType to linked objects, so we're still trying to make it bulletproof. Any suggestions would really be helpful!
 
I think I'll have a chance to look at it today. Already looked at the PDFs and see you're using Euclid Symbol font in some expressions and Symbol font in others. That's neither good nor bad, just an observation. Sometimes when a symbol fails in Symbol font (a perennially troublesome one), Euclid Symbol works. Not always.
 
One **more important thing that we have discovered** is not to use PS Type1 fonts with Indesign. For math we use the trutype fonts that come with MathType an for the rest of the text in the books we use OT and TT fonts.
 
Thanks Maria, especially the observation about not using PS Type1 fonts for math. It's always helpful to hear what others have tried, what worked, and what didn't. It seems like though, if you process the equations in the way you describe, they're not editable afterward in MathType. If that's not an issue, then there's no problem, but it's good to know. (With the MathType SDK, there's surely a way to use a script process the EPS equations from EPS/WMF to EPS/none. Such a process would result in EPS equations that MathType could later edit if need be.)
 
Steve, after looking over the documents, it does seem like it's Symbol font that's causing the problem, and switching to Euclid Symbol font should correct the issue. You can do that globally in Word by changing it in 1 equation and keeping the checkbox checked to "use for new equations". Then run the Format Equations command (on the MathType tab in Word), set to format the entire document to the new equation preferences. Then export as EPS/none (which I see you're already using), and place into ID.
 
Interestingly, when I tried Symbol font on EPSs that were placed & linked, it didn't display Greek letters properly, but when I unlinked one of the equations you had embedded (#34 in the ID document) and used Symbol font, everything looked OK.
 
In the example tests I provided, you did notice I switched to Euclid Symbol for several exercises as I had a hunch that good, old Symbol font was causing problems. I've yet to see any issues with Euclid Symbol so far.
 
Just to confirm what we've been seeing in our tests so far: If only 1 character exists in an .eps using Symbol font, any or all other characters in the .eps (even those in different fonts) are also at risk of disappearing?
 
I recommend doing the same that we did in our Windows PCs: uninstall the Symbol font that comes with Windows. This way when we apply the batch treatment to the equations unembedeb by Indesign, any references to the Symbol fonts are substituted for the fonts defined in MathType .eqp file (MathType preferences). Use only Euclid Symbol in the MT equations and in the text of your book. The Symbol font are forbidden in our PCs.
 
Maria, glad to hear the EPSs resulting from your workflow are editable in MathType. Others use Illustrator to manipulate the EPSs from MathType, and this does render them uneditable in MathType. I'm glad your process preserves the integrity as far as MathType is concerned. For years we have wanted to do more with MathType's integration with InDesign, but as a small company so far we haven't been able to devote the resources to do that. We appreciate the work that you and others are doing to solve problems like this. Better EPS support is one thing we hope to place a higher priority on in future MathType versions. Your final question about the equation padding, with the follow-up question -- was this intended for me or for Steve?
 
That question is for Steve. I have opened the indesign sample he sent and noticed that padding problem around his equations (too much white space) and, as you know, is really simple to solve that problem.
 
Hello, I work with MathType on mac (indesign CS6), this is fine except that the square root sign is not quite the same on Mac as on PC. Are there any settings that can change this so that it becomes equally. top line of the character becomes higher on mac.
 
There must be part of the picture that's missing here. As you can see from my brief

Installing the Canon printer on a Ubuntu Linux system is not that much difficult. A Personal Package Archive (PPA) command is available on the web that you can use to install and update the Canon printer driver on your system.
 
When the install finishes, you may now open your web browser and load the following localhost address. You can now find your printer name and model number to set up your printer on the browser web interface.

After installing the Synaptic package manager, please open it and find the following library tools. When the search result appears, install the Canon Cups driver tools from the Synaptic package manager.
 
In modern Linux distributions, a native printer driver software comes pre-installed with a printer database. Here, we will see how to use the Foomatic DB on a Ubuntu system to configure a Canon printer.
 
After adding your printer to your device, you can use the printer to print documents through a local area network system. You need to find the network printer to configure with your device. Ubuntu also allows you to connect the printer through the device URL.
 
After downloading, you need to install it through the software store of Ubuntu. If you still have an issue with your printer, you can download the source code of the printer driver and install it through installing software via the source-code on Linux.
 
Thank you so much for the above information
I have been trying for days to get my canon MG 3650S to connect to Zorin and finally after following your instructions it now works! Mission accomplished.
thank you again
 
The Canon Australia website no longer provides driver downloads and refers you to set up assistance and then tel. # where they advise you Canon no longer supports Linux. Found the driver in Canon Europe
 
Has anyone managed to get the old iP2600 Canon Pixma working on ubuntu20?
I still hold on to u16 because of the lack of out-of-the-box support for the iP2600.
Got it working under Ubuntu14 or even earlier, but cannot remember how I did it!

Install the rpmextract package, and extract both rpm packages using rpmextract.sh. Extracting both files will create a var and a usr directory - move the contents of both directories into the corresponding root directories.
 
In response.xml you will find a tag that contains the firmware download URL. Next, download the firmware, push it to the printer, and let the printer process it. Before that is done, change the Admin password to something known, it will be used as the user to log into the FTP site (VERY bad practice, do not do this).
 
Brother provides a shell script to create udev rules to prevent the use of IPP-over-USB. This might solve USB printing problems but means that you need to use the legacy LPR driver. See the FAQ article.
 
There are many possible drivers for Canon printers. Many Canon printers are supported by Gutenprint and foomatic-db-ppds. Some of Canon's LBP, iR, and MF printers use a driver supporting the UFR II/UFR II LT/LIPSLX protocols, #UFRII . Others use the #CARPS, or #cnijfilter (cnijfilter2AUR / cnijfilter2-binAUR[broken link: package not found]), or Canon CAPT drivers.
 
Many LBP, iR, and MF printers use a protocol that has had several names over the years: UFR II, UFR II LT, LIPSLX. There are multiple packages for these printers in AUR, and at least the imageCLASS MF4570dn and i-SENSYS MF633C are reported to only work with the older v3.70 version.
 
Some of Canon's printers use Canon's proprietary CARPS (*Canon Advanced Raster Printing System*) driver.Rainbow Software have managed to reverse engineer the CARPS data format and have successfully created a CARPS CUPS driver, which is available as carps-cups-gitAUR.The project's GitHub page includes a list of working printers.
 
Some of the PPD files in epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2AUR are missing paper size definitions for media that is supported by the printers and the filter. It is relatively straightforward to add the missing media types to the PPD files.
 
To begin, download the PKGBUILD for the epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2AUR package, either with an AUR helper or from a snapshot tarball. Once in the directory with the PKGBUILD, download and extract the source of the package by running makepkg --nobuild.
 
Identify the PPD used by your printer in the ppd directory. For example, a Workforce 7710 printer uses Epson-WF-7710\_Series-epson-escpr2-en.ppd. Let us call it your\_ppd\_filename. Convert the relevant PPD to a PPD compiler source file using the ppdi utility from the cups package.
 
The pair of numbers 612.00 1008.00 represents the width and height of the paper in inches, multiplied by 72. Replace all three instances of these numbers with the dimensions of the paper you want to add. For example to add 11"x17" paper, replace the numbers with 792.00 1224.00.
 
The string "Legal/US Legal" identifies the paper. On the left side of the slash, Legal is a magic identifier that the filter uses to identify the paper size. Replace it with the one you want to use. Refer to the mediaSizeData array in optBase.h for a list of possible values. The string to the right of the slash can be set to any human-readable value.
 
If you want to enable borderless printing for a paper size, prefix the magic identifier string you just found with the letter T. So Letter would become TLetter. Additionally, change the four numbers 8.40 8.40 8.40 8.40 to 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00.
 
This will create a ppd file in the ppd directory with a file name derived from the PCFileName parameter in your\_ppd\_filename.drv. You can test this file by uploading it to the CUPS web interface, or install it permanently by overwriting the original PPD file and making the package with makepkg.
 
hplip provides drivers for HP DeskJet, OfficeJet, Photosmart, Business Inkjet, and some LaserJet printers, and also provides an easy to use setup tool. See -linux-imaging-and-printing/supported\_devices/index for the list of supported printers.
 
hplip requires python-pyqt5 to run the GUI qt frontend. hp-setup requires CUPS to be installed and cups.service to be started to save the printer. hp-setup also requires the lsusb software, which is provided by the usbutils package.
 
If your printer is listed as requiring a binary plugin, install the hplip-pluginAUR package from AUR.If the binary plugin hplip-pluginAUR is a requirement you will need to start the cups.service before the PPD is recognized by hplip. If that does not work, reboot and log in with the printer *off*. Then switch it on and run a test print.
 
Keep in mind you can use the automated installer but doing so will leave the resulting changes untracked. The PPD will be installed into /usr/local/lexmark/lxk08/etc/ or similar, depending on the printer model.
 
Install openprinting-ppds-pxlmono-ricohAUR if your device is black and white, or openprinting-ppds-pxlcolor-ricohAUR if it is color. Note that Ricoh copiers are sometimes branded as Savin, Gestetner, Lanier, Rex-Rotary, Nashuatec, and/or IKON. So, if you have a device bearing one of these brands, it may be supported by these drivers as well.
 
Since 2016, or 2017, Samsung is no longer in the printers/scanners business. As of 2019, HP partially support some of Samsung printers/scanners. Before 2016, Samsung was a major player. Which is why there are still many Samsung machines around. In addition, Linux, and cups, keep evolving. The bottom line of all this is that supporting Samsung products is at a flux.
 
A major site for information about Samsung printers/scanners is Samsung Unified Linux Driver Repository. Despite its name, it is not affiliated by Samsung (HP). Neither it is devoted only to samsung-unified-driverAUR. Yet the actual drivers suggested are the closed source from Samsung (HP). samsung-unified-driver, on the other hand, also encompass Windows and Mac. It might be the first stop to get a driver for a Samsung printer and scanner as it, or was, claim to support practically every one of these. Note that samsung-unified-driver includes software that can stand on its own, not tied to cups. If you can not get the printer to work with cups, you might try this route.
 
You should also note that many Samsung printers support PostScript. Chances are that it will work with CUPS generic postscript printer, especially if it is only black & white and only printer, without a scanner added to it. Generic driver may be missing functionality or limited, for example in their support for duplex, color control, and resolution settings, and print quality may be lower.
 
Install the xerox-phaser-6010 package (archived from the AUR).The driver may require older versions of nettle and gnutls to be installed, since the binary blob linked against older versions of the shared libraries provided by those packages. The oldest known-good versions are nettle-2.7.1-1 and gnutls-3.3.13-1.
 
Half of those canon drivers do not work without considerable messing around with various dependancies. This should be made clear otherwise someone might be inclined to buy a canon printer for their linux system on the back of thinking that canon ostensibly provides linux drivers for them.
 
I say all of the above on the back of several bad experiences with canon printers and linux machines on both my own machine and helping out with those of others. When my canon LBP2900i finally dies, I will never buy another canon printer to go with linux.
 
Sure dependencies sometimes are a problem, but if a user is going to install firmware/drivers themselves, I will assume they know what they are doing. Otherwise go HP, they have better support out of the box than Canon do.
 
Canon printers are the bane of my life. I use a Canon LBP2900i laser printer and it has not worked properly on any Debian based distro since Ubuntu 12.04LTS. I now do all o

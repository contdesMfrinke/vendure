$50 seems a lot to pay for what it does, especially as there are a number of ways to do virtually the same in PS .... for those with the extended version of CS5 check out Planet Photoshop www.planetphotoshop.com/natural-3d-light-effect.html ... my guess you could use this as a base template once done and apply to just about any image with a little tweaking

I liked Corey Barker's tutorial too. After some testing the Light Rays filter
has lots of controls but can be a bit harsh. Corey's method looks more natural. Too bad I don't have Extended.

Make compositing a breeze with this powerful compositing toolbox. If you're a beginner, you'll be able to apply advanced techniques with just a few clicks and without prior knowledge; besides, you will learn along the way. If you're a pro, you'll love how the plugin makes many of your tasks automatic, easy, and super-fast.
 
Compositing is the main essence of Photoshop and a challenging skill to master. Although stunning composites may seem difficult to create for beginners, it is mostly the same techniques that are used over and over again, for instance:
 
If you don't have a comprehensive look, overlay, and texture library, we do. The plugin includes high-quality looks, endless textures, and light effects to give your images the final touch. All effects can be applied with one click and can be edited non-destructively. For the looks, you can even use a random function to suggest further variations. Therefore, you can create an endless number of looks one click at a time!

This plugin was created as a collaboration between Unmesh Dinda and Picture Instruments. If you want to learn Photoshop, it won't take long to find Unmesh's Youtube channel: PiXimperfect, where you can also discover numerous videos about compositing. As a Photoshop trainer, he knows all the techniques and has a unique talent for teaching them in an easy-to-understand way. The plugin contains all his professional knowledge about compositing and the many techniques he works with daily. No more long searches in Photoshop for the right tool, no trial and error to pick the right colors, and no complex layering. Most functions are available in the plugin with 1-2 clicks, and the plugin also calculates the correct size or ideal color values directly, if necessary, for the best results.
 
**Create Better Photoshop Composites with Ease**  
The whole concept is simple: By using a step-by-step approach, PiXimperfect makes it easy for those unfamiliar with Photoshop tools and techniques to create effective Photoshop composites. Instead of having to learn many different techniques, and knowing what you need to do to create a realistic composite, you simply follow the tool options, top to bottom.
 
**PiXimperfect Compositing Plugin**  
Es gibt Photoshop-Plugins fr fast alles, aber bis jetzt gab es noch nie ein so Spezielles fr die Erstellung professioneller Compositings wie das PiXimperfect Compositing Plugin.
 
It's understandable. Capturing the Milky Way can be hard. Our home galaxy is faint, it requires a longer exposure than many beginners have tried, light pollution is an an additional challenge, and indeed, getting something good out of your image is a heap of processing work in Photoshop.
 
Early this year I took a look at Astro Panel 2.0. It is a Photoshop plugin that is for the fairly technical user who really wants to work with masks and gradients and there are enough other controls to make a 747 pilot happy. Astro Panel 3.0 offers the same depth of controls but with a new panel filled with more automatic functions.It's called a Smart Panel.
 

What the author of Astro Panel, Angelo Perrone has now done is added a lot of tools that are one touch fixes, using the intelligence of the software to make good decisions about sharpening, noise reduction, eliminating light pollution effects, getting good color balance and much more.
 
The glow to the lower left are the lights of Tucson, Arizona.The panel has tools for virtually eliminating the light pollution, but they aren't one touch tools and I wanted to show what a beginning Milky Way photographer could do. This kind of improvement took a lot of time and effort in the old days. Since Astro Panel 3 has multiple levels of undo, it's easy to experiment and eliminate mistakes.
 
Astro Panel 3.0 is a free upgrade for version 2 owners. Otherwise it's 30 Euros or $33.84 in the U.S. If the webpage comes up in Italian click on the British flag to get the English version of the website with a complete list of features and example photos. Other languages are supported as well.
 
I don't do astro enough to learn the photoshop techniques so this sounds ideal for me, gonna purchase now and give it a shot. The login every 2 weeks sounds like a pain so already looking forward to not having to do that when the new version comes out! English tutorials will be nice too! Cheers.
 
So, if one is "put off by the difficulty of the processing techniques using Photoshop" as well as its cost (like me), they are unlikely to own (or rent -- thanks, Adobe) a copy of Photoshop. That makes the target audience for this product a lot smaller than the universe of photographers (no pun intended) who might be interested in doing Milky Way photography.
 
Oniric is a non-destructive glow plugin for Photoshop. It is a highly customizable glow generator that creates life like light that can be applied to any image in photoshop to enhance drama. Landscape and commercial photographers will find Oniric especially useful.
 
The plugin is very easy to use which makes it a great choice for photographers who do not want to do too much editing in Photoshop. Great results can be achieved with the movement of just a few sliders and since the plugin is non destructive, users can always go back and tweak the glow at a later point in time. When you find a look that you like you can save it as a preset so it can be recreated again in the future.
 
Oniric can generate two different types of glow which have their own practical uses. My personal favorite is the Diffuse glow which simulates natural light. This is a great option for landscape photographers who want to enhance the light that is already in the scene.
 
The second type of glow is streaks. This glow is a great option for graphic artists and compositors and looks best when applied to individual elements of a scene such as text or a piece of an image like a flashlight. The image below was generated using the streaks glow method.
 
The**intensity slider** is like the opacity slider in Photoshop. It controls how intense the the effect of the following sliders become. The **threshold slider** allows users to control what parts of the image receive the glow. It is essentially a luminocity mask. When the slider is set to the left, only the very brightest parts of the image receive the glow effect. As you drag the slider to the right the brightness threshold drops so slightly darker parts of the image begin to glow as well.
 
The **Radius Slider** controls how far the glow reaches into the scene from the initial glow source. As the slider is moved to the right, the glow travels further from its source. The **Exposure Slider** controls how bright the source of the glow is. When you just want to accent the natural light in a scene, you may want to leave this slider set to zero. If you want to create a little more mood or a blowout, bump the exposure slider to right a little bit.
 
You can add a color cast to the glow using the colorize feature. This ensures that your glow fits into the color scheme of your image. When you turn on colorize, you have access to the hue, saturation and luminance sliders to to further craft your light.
 
Oniric is incredibly useful software for photographers and graphic designers who want a non destructive way of streamlining their workflow. It is the perfect tool to create dreamy landscapes in photoshop. The plugin creates realistic glow effects that can greatly enhance the natural light in a scene and helps give your images a finished look. Oniric creates incredible results all on its own, but combining the plugin with traditional dodge and burn layers for foreground elements often yields the best results. For $119, it is one of the most powerful and useful plugins on the market. Feel free to ask me any questions about the plugin in the comments below.

Light-wraps are an effective and underutilized technique that improves the realism of a compositor VFX. These simulate the apparent diffusion of extremely bright lights around a foreground, helping to integrate the composited layer into the background. This visually blends the two different layers, creating a cohesive unified final image.
 
An artist may also want to add a light-wrap for stylistic purposes to visually exaggerate the intensity of a source of light. For example, a dragon breath can be given a stronger light wrap to communicate its deadly heat; or the opening doorway of a UFO blinding the onlookers to reinforce their mysterious nature. Digitally, a pixel can only reach a maximum luminance of 1 (white), so to create a sense of limitless intensity, the implied brightness is reinforced by a light-wrap.
 
Light-wraps in After Effects work best when working in a **32-bit project with an sRGB linear workspace**. This provide

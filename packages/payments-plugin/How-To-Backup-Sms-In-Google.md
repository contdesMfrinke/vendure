Selected documents and music folders in my Mac user account, all looked OK then....nothing, no movement. Stuck at 0% even though it says updating 2,367 files and 1 sec remaining. Nothing, nada. I've rebooted, removed the external drive I wanted to also backup, re-installed Dropbox, no other cloud service-connected files are present in anything I want to backup, tried automatic backups on and off....but nothing. The 'Backup now' is also greyed out whatever I do. I've looked at various Db help pages but nothing. Any ideas appreciated.

I got a popup window about updating dropbox backup. Why? Is this scam to get my info? Is it necessary? Asking for more info led me to the page "How to update Dropbox Backup" and I don't understand what is explained on the page. Currently, whenever I change a document in dropbox, all of the documents change wherever I access them. Can someone explain?

Walter thanks for responding. The popup window disappeared after I kept moving it around the desktop to try to set it to the side. It only had a green button at top left, not a red or yellow. Anyway, it directed me to this webpage if I wanted to know more. The popup gave me a choice to update dropbox backup or to 'learn more'... here's the website where I was sent to 'learn more.' I'm pretty tech savvy and I can't follow what it's all about. -backup
 
Hannah, thanks for attesting to the legitimacy. I did read through the page the link took me to and I honestly couldn't make sense of it. I couldn't tell what would be different from how it is now. I believe (I have Apple products) that whatever I do not (ie change something in a spreadsheet) does stay changed if I access dropbox from either of my laptops or from my iPhone. I think in the past it did work with Time Machine. What are the differences? I really couldn't understand.
 
Jay, thank you. I am so confused. I went to the page you showed a link to. There is one backup from 5:45 pm yesterday, the 8th of April. It's the only backup. I don't know how the new backup system is different from the syncing. Is it a backup to an external drive? Or supposed to be backed up to an external drive? I'm usually good with technology. I don't know why I'm stumped by this.
 
On the other hand, there's also the External Drive backup feature that allows you to back up an external hard drive directly to your Dropbox account on dropbox.com, without the need to store it on your computer.
 
I have the same problem, using a Macbook. The pop-up window appeared, and cannot be closed - none of the coloured buttons top left are active, so the window is blocking my screen. The only options are update now, or on start-up. There is no indication that this is a valid intrusion from Dropbox. Because of this community exchange, I accepted the update (which then produc es another confusing message about disabling the update). Please could you improve this for Mac users? Thank you.
 
Previously, I used to be able to see my Mac represented on my Dropbox as a folder (I had enabled the backup option). This was super convenient because I could easily access my files on-the-go using my Dropbox iPhone app.
 
However, due to a computer issue, I needed to wipe my MacBook Pro clean and reinstall everything (including Dropbox). I enabled backup for my MacBook. However, now, it doesn't show me the MacBook folder like it used to. So I can't access my files on the go. It shows me that I have backed up my files and I am able to see them through a web browser. However, the folder representing my MacBook (backup) has stopped showing on Dropbox.
 
I agree with the poster above.. this has made things very troublesome by not allowing everything to be read via the mobile app. I understand the principle of having the major "backups" be in a different segment of dropbox.. but it shouldnt be that hard to access all the files. Maybe inside the regular current Dropbox app, feature a button that allows up to actually open the files that are in this "backups" section? OR maybe create another "Dropbox Backups" app that will allow us to remotely view these backup files without having to go thru the browser?
 
Is it a joke? I can't access my desktop data from the iPhone or iPad App? What a stupid idea. The whole Dropbox behavior is awful on a mac. We pay for the service and it gets worse and worse with every update.
 
Don't confuse your Dropbox data (files located within your Dropbox folder) with the data saved through use of the Backup feature. Your Dropbox data is accessible in the mobile apps. It's just your backup data that can only be viewed through the website.
 
Yes, I think the posters above understand this. It's just that the developers \_took away\_ a feature (access to backup files via iphone or ipad) that was very useful before to many people, without any appreciable benefit....
 
thanks for the quick answer, but i want use my Desktop files on other devices. This was the normal behavior in the past (4-5 month ago). Now Dropbox launch a "Backup" App and we can't use these files on other devices? Sorry this is stupid. I have enough real backups. I don't need another online backup for my desktop files. Why did Dropbox change it?
 
I've gone through the steps of unlinking Dropbox from each computer. Checking their names in System Preferences and also in the Security tab of my Dropbox account. The computer names are correct in Dropbox but the backup feature is still creating the folders as just Mac
 
OK, they are finally rolling up a Beta update for Dropbox Backup that will let you rename and I was able to do it! You can do go through Dropbox Backup in the app, disable the backups on all the computers there, and then restart them. Then, re-enable backups and it should move you over to beta so you can now rename things!
 
I noticed that my Desktop folder was moved in there and the actual Desktop folder is now a symlink pointing to Desktop in My Mac (123.dhcp.mysip.com), and while I could rename it and fix the symlink, it seems like this may cause issues with Dropbox looking at the wrong places in the future, e.g. when adding/removing backup folders at the very least.

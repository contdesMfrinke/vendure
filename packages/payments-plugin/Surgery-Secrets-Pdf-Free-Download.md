For pregnancy Support Tape can be used to support the bump and lower back, it can also be used immediately after delivery to support the belly and loose skin.
For weight loss Support Tape can be used throughout the weight loss journey to aid in skin retraction as the weight is decreasing.
 
No there is not. Support Tape is proven to be an effective tool to aid in supporting skin retraction at any time. However the results will be more dramatic at the time of either surgery, pregnancy and so on.
 
We recommend ordering the Stage 1 Faja based on your current hip measurement and including your waist and height in the order notes so this can be adjusted for you if required. The hip measurement is taken around the body at the widest part of the buttocks. If your measurement is at the top end of the size please order the next size up.
 
Place the tape measure around your body, just below the bust. Squeeze well but without taking your breath away and write down that measure. If it is not accurate, round to the nearest inch. Find your size according to the table 1.
 
Now place the tape measure around your bust in the upper back and the highest point of your breast. Now subtract this measure from the measurement in step 1. The difference in inches is the size of the suggested cup. If the difference is between sizes, according to the table 2, round down.

Knowledge, creativity and wisdom are key components in the value of using your head. Knowledge is crucial because it's just as important to know what we can't do, as knowing what we can do. Creativity is required when the problems we face are unique or when the old solutions won't work. And it is just as important, if not more so, having the wisdom of knowing what operation not to perform.
 
With so many wonderful patients singing our praises, we should be walking on cloud nine. But the reality is, the small few that are not happy (and may never be) weighs on us far more than all the positive outcomes combined.
 
During a consultation, we sometimes come across patients who we feel cannot be satisfied and we do our best to identify this group, choosing not to take them as a patient in the first place (and saving ourselves a headache).
 
But it's not a reliable system and people slip through the cracks. Despite all our efforts before surgery to make sure a patient's expectations are realistic and doing what we can to achieve their desired results, we can't make everyone happy all the time.
 
Some surgeons aren't affected by it and seem just to brush it off; others are outright mean and divert the blame on the patient. That's not how things are handled in my or my partners' practices. We take it to heart, probably too much, and it can be crushing.
 
Ask anyone in their 40s, 50s or 60s who looks younger than their actual age about aging gracefully, and they'll have the same advice: take care of your skin and protect it from the sun. This means applying 30+ SPF daily, using sunscreen that has a zinc mechanical blocker and free of oxybenzone chemical blocks. I repeat... daily. Even if it's overcast, UV light damages DNA in the skin (along with smoking), and once the damage is done, it's permanent.
 
With damaged skin comes the appearance of fine lines and age spots associated with old age. If you haven't been religious about applying sunscreen, it's not too late to start, and you can prevent future DNA damage.
 
To repair existing damage, you may need to wind the clock back with a chemical peel or some skin lasering. The tan 20-somethings of today will be the lined- and older-looking 40-somethings of tomorrow.
 
I hear from so many patients and plenty of surgeons that bigger is always better when it comes to breast implants, but this is shortsighted advice. If a patient feels this way now, they will change their mind eventually (even if it's 20 years down the road).
 
Being a surgeon in a mature practice, I see more patients in their 50s and 60s interested in a breast reduction or breast lift, rather than wanting to go larger. Bigger is definitely not always better.
 
The surgery is a stepping stone, but it's up to the patient to take it the rest of the way by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. A tummy tuck is a great and powerful medicine and like all such things should be treated with care.
 
Drooping or hanging necks are caused by loose skin, fat under the muscle, or a combination of these and more. A plastic surgeon can diagnose what's going on, and if it's just fat under the skin that's causing the heaviness, then liposuction may be a better option with a faster recovery time than Kybella.
 
Kybella is not Botox or Juvederm. Unlike these two products, Kybella is more invasive, has a longer recovery time and works marginally well in comparison.If the area under your chin is bothering you and you're considering Kybella, schedule a consultation. Kybella may be the answer, but it's not for every patient. A doctor will know and can help make the right decision based on what's best for you.
 
Finally, be wary of "cosmetic medicine specialists" such as dermatologists or family practitioners. Believe it or not, I've seen patients who've had liposuction performed by OB/GYNs, radiologists, family practitioners, dermatologists and neurologists. Not only do they have minimal training compared to plastic surgeons, it's easy for a doctor to claim they perform plastic surgery. It is very hard, however, to train to be a real plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.
 
All plastic surgeons and practices are not created equal. We have different abilities and different levels of experience. Compare results by looking at before and after photos on their website and critique them carefully. Use resources like online reviews to read testimonials and seek referrals from former patients. Schedule a consultation and trust your intuition!
 
Choose a plastic surgeon who frequently performs the procedure you want to have done (this goes for any surgery). Again, use your common sense but be sure to do your homework too. Most people don't realize that not all plastic surgeons specialize exclusively in cosmetic surgery. In fact, 90% do not.
 
Most plastic surgeons perform fewer than 15 facelifts per year. Wouldn't you prefer to go to a plastic surgeon who performs 100 per year? In my professional opinion, with experience comes better results and more satisfied patients.

The third edition of this book contains a thorough update of the clinical information and the introduction of 15 new chapters, exploring topics such as 'osteonecrosis of the jaws' and 'craniofacial syndromes'. Many of the new inclusions were in response to feedback received by the editor, which in turn reflects the relevance of these topics to the target audience of this book.
 
The original edition was published in 2001, and with over 80 contributors to the third edition's 58 chapters, this book gives succinct and relevant information on an impressive range of topics within oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS).
 
This book is aimed at those with an interest in OMFS, but is also accessible to undergraduate students through to new junior staff starting in the speciality. The level of detail included would be valuable to registrars with exams looming. The practical layout lends this book to use as both a study aid and a quick 'on the ward' reference guide.
 
On this episode of The Natural Plastic Surgeon Podcast, Dr. Barrett sits down with the wonderful Anna Katharina to discuss topics and secrets such as how Plastic Surgery is treated within The Modeling Industry, Anna Katharina's own true crime podcast, a surgery disaster, and choosing the right breast implants for you. In addition, they'll talk about the surgery complications that can come with an improper breast implant and how she remains true to herself in the modeling industry and the greater state of influencers today.
 
Dr. Daniel Barrett (00:49):  
Everybody, we're here. This is episode 43 of the Natural Plastic Surgeon podcast. We have one of my favorite patients here, Anna Katharina. And she is an Instagram model. She is a spokesperson for Bang energy drink.
 
Dr. Daniel Barrett (01:59):  
Yeah. Okay. Well here, I want to dive into that, but let's talk about your podcast really quick first, because I want to tease everybody to wait till the end so we can talk about the meat of this, which is the plastic surgery experience-
 
Anna Kathrina (02:23):  
I got really into abnormal psychology when I was a sophomore in college. I think a lot of it was preventative. It's kind of a morbid interest when y

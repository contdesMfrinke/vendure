Finally, we really do believe in the phrase 'a rising tide lifts all ships'. In our view, we all need to create memorable experiences from the very first time a player steps onto a squash court. The more we create magical moments for newcomers to the sport, the greater the likelihood that the squash community will not only survive but thrive.
 
Increasing the number of qualified coaches at the grassroots level provides better opportunities for people to try the sport and have a great experience. This, in turn, leads to increased participation at squash clubs and venues as well as support for our National Governing Bodies. More people enjoying playing squash regularly will raise the profile of the professional game, increasing visibility and bringing the sport to a wider audience.
 
This alone is not going to fix all the challenges that squash is facing, but it's a step in the right direction. And with your help, we're determined to welcome as many people to the sport as we can to ensure that squash has a bright future.
 
Our aim is to lower the barrier to entry for people to get into coaching. That's why we made sure that you can complete the World Squash Foundation Coaching Award online without needing access to a court. Our hope is that you enjoy your first steps into coaching and that it motivates you to progress onwards to take your Level 1 certificate through your National Governing Body.

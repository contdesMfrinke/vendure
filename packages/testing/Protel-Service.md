Protel is one of the more commonly used PMS systems among our customers, and we have a long-standing history of partnership and collaboration. Protel developed the initial integration to support our legacy systems (Allegro v5 kiosk and v6 online). This solution has since been deployed to hundreds of hotels using our self-service products to make guest check-in Safe, Simple, and Efficient.
 
We completed our Allegro v5 kiosks integration for Protel.I/O in early 2019 when we received our Certification. The integration has been continuously improved and extended as a result of the Protel.I/O and Ariane development team collaboration. We are now incredibly proud to announce that our entire product range has full and complete Protel.I/O support. This includes our outdoor and indoor kiosks, online and mobile services running Allegro v5, v6, or Allegro Cloud v7.
 
We have also worked on additional functionality, including improved product upsell and support for compartments (distribution of classical room keys). A majority of our mutual hotel customers have been or are in the process of being migrated to Protel.I/O to ensure we all benefit from this next-generation ESB.
 
Ariane has been a great partner for us for many years. Together we have many hundreds of customers enjoying the great solution & integration we have between our products. For years, the Ariane team has been a great hospitality-minded team, full of passion and a high level of quality service.

The status page helps you to check the current online status of protel Air and the protel Cloud Services, and should there be an issue, it can be dealt with more quickly (by us), as we will all literally be working from the same page, viewing the same data and managing all responses centrally.

**Thoughts**: Wachsmuth & Krogmann was founded in 1797 as a shipping company in Hamburg, Germany, and has since evolved into an international trading company headquartered in Hong Kong. Its U.S. operations are based in the suburbs of Chicago, in an office building it shares with Crane USA. This is not a coincidence, as Crane is not only a regular supplier of Aldi products but is a subsidiary of Wachsmuth & Krogmann. However, in another twist, most Crane-branded products sold at Aldi are not serviced through this contact information but through other after-sales service companies.

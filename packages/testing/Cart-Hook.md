Our industry experience and historic data show a large drop in conversion rates between the second and third offer. Our goal is to help increase your average order value with post-purchase revenue, however, we must always keep the customer in mind and make sure they have a delightful experience.
 
Yes. The customer can bypass the post-purchase funnel at any time by clicking the view order confirmation link included at the top of each post-purchase offer page. The customer can also simply close their browser after completing the initial checkout order.

My first question is very basic : how to detect when user adds a product ? The 'cart' hook is nice, but also trigegred on cart creation, product update, product delete, etc. and i can't figure a way to guess which user action triggered the hook.
 
Why do you want to adding a product to cart with quantity 0? Having a product with quantity 0 in your cart is the same as NOT having that product in the cart. Or, in reverse logic, you'd already have every single product in your cart, but with the quantity 0. lol

Q: what is the difference between these 2 files and "/includes/hooks/MyModule.php" ? Because when I move the hooks from /servers/ to /includes/ they now fire as I would expect. For instance **ClientAreaPageCart**hook now fires when I'm on the page. What are the reasons for having the various places to put hooks?
 
There may be another way (besides manually) to get it in the list, but I found that by "resaving" any of the Products/Services that uses my module (Product>Module Settings), it was put back in the list.
 
probably often... I mean, if you were coding a navbar hook to change the a menu in the client area, you wouldn't necessarily create an addon module just for that simple purpose - you could and it would work, but i'd consider it overkill.
 
**What i need to do:**I want to run some checks on a product before being added to the cart.More exactly:I want to compare the product i am about to add to the cart, with the ones already added, to see if there are some conflicts. An example:Let's say we have a product named "Both shoes", and a product "left shoe".A user adds "left shoe" to the cart. Then he adds "both shoes". I want to print an error instead of adding the "both shoes": Sorry, but you can't add both shoes if you've added left shoe to the cart. If you want to buy "both shoes", please first remove "left shoe".

I imagine it would be something like "woocommerce\_added\_to\_cart", but couldn't find anything like that. I know there is an ajax event "added\_to\_cart" but it will be a lot of code for me to do that via ajax.
 
**Update - my use case:** I am making slack notifications on my wc shop. All of my "Add to cart" buttons are ajax, and it takes approximatively 0.6 seconds from clicking "Add to cart" until it appears in the cart. If I add my slack notification with "woocommerce\_add\_to\_cart" hook then it waits until it delivers the notification to slack and then updates the cart which is up to 2 seconds, which is too much. Best case scenario would be to have a php hook that fires **after** the product was successfully added to cart, which will not affect it.
 
I need to run a function on only cart page so I need a hook which runs only on cart page. Actually I am reloading saved cart from table when I go to cart page.I tried to use is\_cart() but didn't worked.
 
You should call a hook that only runs on the cart page. Here is one example of a visual guide of possible hooks to call on the cart page - just make sure that you know where the hook is getting called, and that it doesn't interfere with any of the other functions of that cart page.
 
Hey boehmmedia,
I believe that you do have the right hook, but that you have not added any html tags to add text into the table, since I assume that your function looks something like this with just plan text:
 
This yaeger cart stand hook will mount over the lip of your yaeger case cart (NOT for the PRO) & allow you to carry a monitor or steadi stand. I prefer to mount my bracket near the sticks (see photos).
 
**WooCommerce is extremely friendly for developers because it has a ton of actions and filters - called hooks. We use them often when we develop WooCommerce plugins and tweak our cart page, here at WP Desk. No matter if you are a beginner or advanced WooCommerce developer, we created this visual guide to help you find just the WooCommerce cart page hooks you're looking for. Let's begin!**
 
we finally have some stand hooks for the backstage carts. these hooks should fit any backstage cart out there with the flat lip shelf like the TR-01, 02, 03 , 04 or 05 carts. the hooks allow you to carry any stand you use for your monitors or steadicam. unlike the backstage hooks, these are heavy duty steel and will not bend.
 
The Film Devices location sound cart cable hook has 5 positions. The mounting holes are located at the top for easy mounting. They can bolted, or screwed to any surface or mounted to T-Slot Profiles. The T-slot profile in the illustration is not included.
 
What if I need to create a function for a core addon function that does not have a hook I can use. Such as render\_newsletter in the news and email addon. How would I get access to the body variable used in the render\_newsletter function? Is it even possible without a hook?
 
Have a look at our StoreCustomizer plugin which has lots of extra useful features for your cart page which you will enjoy from auto-update cart, add banners or custom text, remove the cart product links and more.

Thank you for your great effort for us,  
can you help me understand the reason behind, following hooks according to your visual guide should be inside cart totals table, but they are getting printed before/above cart totals table,
 
Very helpful, using visual guides like this helps me edit and style our WC store so much quicker with placement of whatever I need where I need it. The more you can add like this for other pages would be awesome.
 
hi, Rodolfo Melogli, illustrious one, could you tell me how I can make my shopping cart page of woocommmerce divided into two columns, so that the part of the total cart next to it, as they have in amazon, thanks to be many before hand.
 
Hello, thanks for the guide.  
Nevertheless I have a problem I cannot find the solution for.  
In my instance of woocommerce, the last entry in the cart pricing list is the tax amount. I want to show the total amount in the last position instead. Where can you change the order of the cart total prices?
 
Hello, the code works fine, could you tell us how to add a space before starting the hook content? the text we give starts only from the hook, we need a space after the hook for proper alignment and better visual appearance!
 
How can add-to-cart form be customized using hook\_form\_alter. Or better yet can layouts like display suite or panels be applied to the add to cart form using hook\_form\_alter? I have custom line item types that I would like to show using some kind add\_to\_cart form regions in 2 or 3 stacked columns.

items is meant to contain a list of grocery items while onItemClick is meant to hold a reference to an event handling function. In GroceryCart.js, we import and then render ItemList components:


 
In ItemList.js, the itemList function returns a div which consists of a series of buttons. We iterate over items using a variable called item and create buttons with attributes ... value=item onClick=handleClick ...
 
In this exercise, we are dealing with function components. If you look in the file GroceryCart.js, we have declared and initialized state with the statement:
const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
The [] within the parentheses tells us that cart is going to be an array, initially an empty array. (If we had initialized it using somether other than [], such as a string or an object , then that would clue us in as to how we mean to store our data in our cart). We can use setCart to change the value of cart.
 
I can not understand how this part of code is working? Can any-one explain it to me same as the above explanations for other parts of the code?
I can not understand what is difference between index & targetIndex, Also I dont understand the logic behind !== which as said in the body of the practice, It would result to True/False value.

The dramatic expansion of internet communication tools has led to the increased use of temporary online groups to solve problems, provide services, or produce new knowledge. However, many of these groups need help to collaborate effectively. The rapid development of new tools and collaboration forms requires ongoing experimentation to develop and test new ways to support this novel form of teamwork. Building on research demonstrating the use of nudges to shape behavior, we report the results of an experiment to nudge teamwork in 168 temporary online groups randomly assigned to one of four different nudge treatments. Each nudge was designed to spur one of three targeted collaborative processes (collaborator skill use, effective task strategy, and the level of collective effort) demonstrated to enhance collective intelligence in extant research. Our results support the basic notion that digitally nudging collaborative processes can improve collective intelligence. However, to our surprise, a couple of nudges had unintended negative effects and ultimately decreased collective intelligence. We discuss our results using structured speculation to systematically consider the conditions under which we would or would not expect the same patterns to materialize in order to clearly articulate directions for future research.

At UF CJC Online, implementing a course template has been transformative as it significantly enhances student success by delivering a consistent learning experience. Further, a cohesive, intuitive, and strategic online learning environment allows students to be actively drawn into the course content, fosters deeper engagement in the online classroom, and facilitates the journey toward achieving the learning objectives.

The transparent communication of course goals, assessments aligned with objectives, and access to top-tier instructional materials and support resources ensures a holistic and enriching learning experience. Notably, since the implementation of the course template, UF CJC Online has observed a remarkable 25% increase in course completion rates, underscoring the tangible impact of its commitment to quality education.
 
Each course within the UF CJC Online program undergoes a meticulous review process facilitated by a peer-review team established through QM. The course review team assesses each course against the QM Rubric in a collegial, collaborative process and generates a detailed report that provides valuable feedback in each of the eight areas for course improvement. The course template is a key factor in the QM course review process as it ensures consistency in course design.
 
While implementing the QM-informed course template has been largely successful, it has not been without challenges. One of the main hurdles has been ensuring the templates remain flexible enough to accommodate the diverse needs and andragogical approaches of different courses and instructors. Additionally, the continuous process of gathering and integrating feedback requires a significant investment of time and resources throughout the year.
 
Looking forward, UF CJC Online is committed to further refining its course template based on ongoing QM reviews and feedback from students and instructors. The goal is to create a living document that evolves with the changing landscape of online education and adopts the highest quality standards.
 
The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity.
 
In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018.
 
Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy.
 
In April 2018, Facebook disclosed that a Cambridge University researcher may have improperly shared the data of up to 87 million of its users with a political consulting firm. This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced.
 
GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues.
 
Congress should consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment. Issues that should be considered include what authorities agencies should have in order to oversee Internet privacy, including appropriate rulemaking authority.
 
Online visibility, or online presence, refers to the amount of attention your brand garners online.2 In other words, how does your brand show up in digital spaces? How many people interact with your brand online?
 
One of the simplest ways to optimize your digital content is with keywords. Keywords are the main terms that users are searching and that apply to your brand (e.g., a car dealership's search keywords would likely be along the lines of "car dealership near me," "local car dealership," "best car dealership.") By using the right keywords on your website, in your ads or in your blog content, you can boost your website's visibility to the top of the search engine results pages for a particular query.5
 
Finding the right keywords can be tricky; you don't want to use terms that aren't relevant to your brand or product. While you want to optimize your site for the most common searches, using only high-traffic, competitive keywords can cause your site to be lost in the shuffle. Keyword tools like Google Keyword Planner and SEMrush can identify potential keywords for each topic and rank them based on traffic, relevance and other factors.
 
On-page SEO deals with the elements of your online presence that are within your control.6 That means directly optimizing your landing pages and website content with relevant keywords. This helps search engine algorithms know that your web pages have the answers that users are looking for.
 
SEO strategies are mainly free yet time-consuming, while PPC advertising is a paid search strategy with targeted ads that deliver

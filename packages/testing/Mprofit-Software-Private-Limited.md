Its limited partners put up $99M for the purchase, meanwhile the private equity firm adds the remaining $1M. In exchange for the $1M, the private equity firm enters into an arrangement with the investors where the private equity firm will take 20% of any profits achieved on the sale of the company.

Five years later, the Company is sold for $300M. After returning the original equity to the partners, the private equity firm is left with a $200M profit. Forty million goes to the private equity firm and the remaining $160M is distributed to the limited partners as profits.
 
If Mitt Romney used his IRA to make an investment in the carry vehicle of the private equity fund, any profits he received from the carried interest would fall into the IRA. He could then use the larger balance in the IRA to make more investments in future deals. I imagine this is how he built up such a large IRA balance.
 
If you think the company is doing well and likely to make a profit, you can make the investment from your taxable account. Any dividends or gains will be taxed at capital gain rates, which are more favorable than ordinary income tax rates but can still be quite steep once you factor in the 3.8% tax for Obamacare and state tax rates for capital gains (usually ordinary income tax).

Woah, interesting piece. Great fact to keep in my mind as I get old and have more capital to invest. Currently I am only putting higher yielding dividend stocks and REITs into my Rot to avoid paying ordinary taxes on the distributions. But never considered the possibility of alternative investments. Those are definitely some eye opening figures and it is insane to me that those profits will all be tax free when drawn from the account. I guess the penalty of withdrawing funds early is well worth the taxes you are not paying.
 
Really interesting article.
You did a great job explaining how carried interest works. I had never really understood that jargon.
And, I had no idea you could make private investments via a ROTH IRA.
 
Hi! I am 48, have a $2m traditional IRA. I want to roll it to a Roth but based on what we make and our state, the rollover would cost $1m. However, I am really interested in a self-directed Roth Ira to start investing in private companies.
 
This is a lawsuit by Margaret Acree, who contends that she and other persons who have similar claims, sustained damages as the result of their purchase of securities from F & M Distributors, Inc. (F & M) in direct violation of existing federal laws.[1]
 
On November 22, 1995, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, in which they generally contend that Acree had failed to set forth any claims upon which relief could be granted. Opposition papers were filed on January 17, 1996. A hearing was conducted on February 21, 1996, after which the matter was taken under advisement.
 
During all of the times that are relevant to this controversy, F & M owned and operated a chain of stores throughout the eastern and midwestern parts of the United States, all of which focused on the sale of a wide selection of health and beauty aids, cosmetics, fragrances and household supplies at discount prices. F & M's commercial success was due in large part to its ability to engage in "deal" and "contract" buying with manufacturers which, in turn, allowed it to offer sales prices that were consistently lower than those of its **\*650** competitors.[2] In August 1993, F & M issued $75 million in 11.5% Senior Subordinated Notes (Notes) in an offering to the public pursuant to a Registration Statement and Prospectus that had been filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[3] On December 5, 1994, F & M filed a Chapter 11 voluntary petition for reorganization.
 
On April 28, 1995, Margaret Acree filed a six count complaint in her own name and on behalf of all other persons who had purchased F & M Notes between August 9, 1993 and December 6, 1994, in which she charged the Defendants with various violations of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1934, and the common law.
 
In Count I of her Complaint, Acree alleged that the Defendants had breached their duty to investigate and verify the accuracy of the statements within F & M's Registration Statement and Prospectus, in violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77k.
 
The charges in Count II were directed against the Underwriter Defendants and the individual Defendants, Agley, and Timmis, whom Acree accused of having (1) drafted, revised, approved and finalized a misleading Registration Statement and Prospectus, and (2) solicited the sale of the Notes.
 
Count III was brought against the Inside Director Defendants for their alleged violation of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77o. This Count contains an allegation that these Defendants, by virtue of their controlling stock positions, senior management positions, and/or director positions, possessed and exercised the power to influence F & M to engage in purposeful misrepresentations and omissions of material facts in its offering materials.
 
Count V addressed the conduct of the Inside Director Defendants who, according to Acree, utilized the power of their stock options to influence F & M to make material misrepresentations in its offering materials.
 
In support of their motion, the Defendants submit that the following factors mandate a dismissal of all of the pending claims against them; to wit, (1) the Complaint alleges a failure to disclose "industry" trends even though there are no federal securities laws which require this form of disclosure; (2) Acree has made allegations which charge them with failing to predict F & M's subsequent business difficulties in the absence of any federal securities laws or regulations that support this claim; (3) the Complaint does not contain any material facts which would warrant the inference that an industry trend existed; (4) the "bespeaks caution" doctrine bars Acree's federal claims as a matter of law because the Prospectus fully disclosed the pertinent risks about which they complain; and (5) the state law negligent misrepresentation claim is without any legal basis because (a) no misrepresentation or omission has been alleged, and (b) there is no independent basis for subject-matter jurisdiction without the federal securities counts.
 
The Defendants attack Count II, maintaining that liability under Section 12 of the **\*651** Securities Act of 1933 can only attach to those persons who are the sellers of the challenged securities. It is their position that Acree has failed to plead (1) the requisite passing of title or (2) the solicitation of an offer to purchase that would transpose the Defendants into "sellers" for the purposes of Section 12. Finally, they submit that Counts III and V should be dismissed because their validity is dependent upon the validity of Counts I, II, and IV, which, according to the Defendants, fail to state a cognizable cause of action.[4]
 
Acree argues that, contrary to the Defendants' contentions, these omissions constituted an intentional concealment of existing facts which had adversely affected F & M's business. According to Acree, the Defendants falsely implied that F & M continued to possess its competitive advantage at the time of the offering, as indicated by the following statements in the Prospectus:
 
(Prospectus at 19). Finally, Acree asserts that the Defendants continued to misrepresent and conceal material facts regarding F & M's business, profitability and cash flow in its press releases, quarterly reports and annual reports to shareholders, all of which generally stated that the Company's purchasing power had improved because of its continued focus on "deal" buying.
 
In support of their motion, the Defendants submit that the information, which Acree contends was purposefully omitted from F & M's public offering, is immaterial to this controversy because they had no duty to disclose "industry trends" or to predict "adverse consequences" of the trend. In her opposition papers, Acree argues that the omissions, to which her Complaint makes reference, rendered all of the other statements in the Prospectus misleading.
 
It is clear from a reading of the Complaint that Acree specifically (1) alludes to the Defendants' failure (a) to disclose a trend from "deal" buying in F & M's industry, and (b) the Company had decreased its "deal" buying at the time of the Note Offering, and (2) this omission rendered the publicly disseminated information relating to F & M's current status as well as the predictive statements about its future misleading. Thus, this Court must attempt to determine (1) whether the Defendants had a duty to disclose a trend from "deal" buying (or that their own deal buying opportunities had evaporated) and (2) if there are enough facts **\*653** to support Acree's contention that the omission rendered the other statements in the Prospectus misleading.
 
The Defendants mischaracterize the industry "trend" that Acree contends was fraudulently concealed from her. They correctly note that the laws which regulate federal securities only deem firm specific information to be material and worthy of disclosure. Wielgos v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 892 F.2d 509 (7th Cir.1989). The non-disclosure of enacted or pending legislation and industry-wide trends is not a legitimate basis for a securities fraud claim. Whirlpool Financial Corp. v. GN Holdings, Inc., 67 F.3d 605 (7th Cir.1995). For instance, in Whirlpool, the plaintiffs argued that the Company had made the following misrepresentation:
 
67 F.3d at 608. The court concluded that this allegation could not form the sole basis for

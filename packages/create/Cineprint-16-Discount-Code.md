**What is it?** I put together a detailed comparison post on the best high-end video stock footage sites available today and several of them were kind enough to give my readers exclusive discount codes.

**What is it?** Riverside.fm is the best way to record a video call when you need pristine quality video and audio and fool-proof ease of use, for even the most technologically nervous end users.
 
**What is it?** Cinema Grade is a revolutionary new way of colour grading your images, inside of your NLE, by clicking and dragging on the part of the image you want to affect, instead of looking away to mess with sliders and dials.
 
Cinema Grade also gives you group grading, shot matching and a seamless integration of LUT based grades, all within your NLE. Plus every purchase comes with two installations and works across Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X and DaVinci Resolve.
 
**More info?** Check out my in-depth review of Cinema Grade here, which includes a free keyboard shortcut cheat sheet you can download and a chat with Denver Riddle, the creator of Cinema Grade.
 
The cool thing about Hedge, that sets it apart from the competition, is that it allows you to do two simultaneous transfers for free, with checksum verification and all. The paid for Pro version allows for unlimited transfers and claims to be as fast as transferring in the Finder but with a secure verification!

**What is it?**MixingLight.com is a subscription based training site run by three professional colorists, supported by a global community of colorists and aimed at those who are, or want to be professional colorists, or at the very least are serious about improving their colour grading skills.
 
**What is it?** Nobe Color Remap is a third-party OFX plugin for DaVinci Resolve which allows you to make custom adjustments with ease using its unique interface. It is also available for FCPX
 
**What is it?** DCP-Transfer is a macOS app that allows you to correctly format off-the-shelf hard drives for Digital Cinema distribution. You can also batch copy DCPs to your drive and validate that existing or new copies are not corrupt. This app will give you the confidence to know that what you are shipping has been correctly formatted and validated.
 
**How much do I save?**DCP-Transfer is available as a monthly or annual subscription. You can save 10% off of both of these, although the annual subscription is designed to be much better value.
 
nuraphone headphones are also the only pair of headphones I own that get better over time with free firmware updates that unlock new features and capabilities, such as the Active Noise Cancellation that the G2 update delivered.
 
**What is it?**Red Giant create all sorts of very cool post production software, largely for After Effects and other graphics packages. Popular products include Trapcode Particular and Colorista, Pluraleyes, Knoll Light Factory and the recently acquired Automatic Duck tools.

Entries have been developed by a wide array of other video game companies, including Midway Games, Atari and Mass Media, Inc., and was created by Toru Iwatani. The eponymous first entry was released in arcades in 1980 by Namco, and published by Midway Games in North America. Most *Pac-Man* games are maze chase games, but it has also delved into other genres, such as platformers, racing, and sports. Several games in the series were released for a multitude of home consoles and are included in many Bandai Namco video game compilations.

*Pac-Man* is one of the longest-running, best-selling, and highest-grossing video game franchises in history, and the game has seen regular releases for over 40 years, has sold nearly 48 million copies across all of the platforms, and has grossed over US$14 billion, most of which has been from the original arcade game. The character of Pac-Man is the official mascot of Bandai Namco, and is one of the most recognizable video game characters in history. The franchise has been seen as important and influential, and is often used as a representation for 1980s popular culture and video games as a whole.
 
***Pac-Man Smash*** is a Pac-Man themed air hockey table released into arcades by Namco Bandai Games. It is a localization of a Japanese air hockey table called *Big Bang Smash*. Japan's *Big Bang Smash* has no references to Pac-Man in it, the Pac-Man references were added into the localization. It is a four way air hockey table with many pucks instead of only one puck.[77]
 
While the series did not go beyond its first four releases, the Arcade Game Series would later be followed by the *Arcade Archives* line by Hamster Corporation, which began publishing Namco titles in late 2021.

All games in the lineup play identically to their arcade counterparts (with the exception of the updated copyright in Ms. Pac-Man and the background stars continuing to move while the game is paused in Galaga, as well as fixed bugs across the games).
 
In addition to the original game settings, each game also includes video options with adjustable screen details and alternate border artwork; as well as audio options, a round select feature, achievements and online leaderboards to compare between global players and friends (for games finished under the default game settings). Due to the presentation of the games, all games no longer have their "ready-to-play" screens and do not feature the 2-player alternating game modes found in the original.

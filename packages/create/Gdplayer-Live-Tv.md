HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) interacts with HVEM and nectin-1 cell receptors to initiate virus entry. We prepared an HSV-1 strain with mutations in the gD gene at amino acid residues 3 and 38 by changing alanine to cysteine and tyrosine to cysteine, respectively (A3C/Y38C). These mutations were constructed with the intent of evaluating infection in vivo when virus enters by HVEM but not nectin-1 receptors and were based on prior reports demonstrating that purified gDA3C/Y38C protein binds to HVEM but not to nectin-1. While preparing a high-titered purified virus pool, the cysteine mutation at position 38 reverted to tyrosine, which occurred on two separate occasions. The resultant HSV-1 strain, KOS-gDA3C, had a single amino acid mutation at residue 3 and exhibited reduced entry into both HVEM and nectin-1 expressing cells. When tested in the murine flank model, the mutant virus was markedly attenuated for virulence and caused only mild disease, while the parental and rescued viruses produced much more severe disease. Thirty days after KOS-gDA3C infection, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of HSV-1 and were highly resistant to disease. The KOS-gDA3C mutation was stable during 30 passages in vitro and was present in each of 3 isolates obtained from infected mice. Therefore, this gD mutant virus impaired in entry may represent a novel candidate for an attenuated live HSV-1 vaccine.

You'll have to fit your GD's time with her father in with your own plans. It's unfortunate but not unusual for previously agreed arrangements to change when parents separate.

If he's no longer sharing the same home with his daughter due to this change in circumstances, they wont be seeing as much of one another as they used too.
 
Wow, the reason I posted the second post was because I had posted on a thread that was old and was advised to start a new thread and who said I was unhappy with the advice given, I have only just seen the responses and I am currently reading through them. How rude are you
 
I appreciate that NSW is huge and they may live a long way from the coast.

However, you are going to have to compromise here.
What is important is your granddaughter maintaining a good relationship with her father and, presumably, his family too.
Does he see his daughter at weekends?

Perhaps try to find somewhere nearer their home for the holiday, or fit the break around his plans.
 
You've also started a thread about this on the 'Ask a Gran' forum. It might be more helpful if you asked for this or that one to be deleted, so those wanting to respond will only have one thread on which to do so.
 
The problem is **Cleverfairy** you now have two threads running simultaneously, one here on the Estrangement forum and one on the 'Ask a Gran' forum, hence the confusion and why I suggested you ask GNHQ to delete one of them.

**Interpretive Summary:** Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection, is one of the most common avian respiratory diseases in the US poultry industry. The disease is mainly controlled through biosecurity and vaccination with live-attenuated strains of the virus and herpesvirus (HVT) and fowlpox virus (FPV) vectored vaccines. However, the current live attenuated ILTV vaccines, (chicken embryo origin [CEO] and tissue culture origin [TCO]), although effective, can regain virulence, whereas the vectored vaccines provide only partial protection. Therefore, there is a need to develop safer and more efficacious vaccines for protection of chickens against the disease. In the present study, we generated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota vaccine-based recombinant viruses expressing the antigenic proteins gB and gD of ILTV. These recombinant vaccines were stable and safe to all age of chicks. Leghorn chickens and broiler chickens vaccinated with these vaccines were protected against virulent ILTV and NDV challenge, showing little or no clinical signs and no decrease in body weight gains. The results suggested that the NDV/ILTV recombinant viruses are safe, stable and effective bivalent vaccines that can be mass-administered via aerosol or drinking water to large chicken populations, which will impact the US poultry industry and make their products (meat and eggs) even more inexpensive to the consumer.
 
**Technical Abstract:** Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of chickens caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). The disease is mainly controlled through biosecurity and vaccination with live-attenuated strains of the virus and vectored vaccines based on turkey herpesvirus (HVT) and fowlpox virus (FPV). The current live attenuated vaccines (chicken embryo origin [CEO] and tissue culture origin [TCO]), although effective, they can regain virulence, whereas HVT- and FPV-vectored ILTV vaccines are less efficacious than live-attenuated vaccines. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop safer and more efficacious ILTV vaccines. In the present study, we generated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) recombinants, based on the LaSota vaccine strain, expressing the glycoproteins B (gB) and D (gD) of ILTV using reverse genetics technology. These recombinant viruses, rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD, were slightly attenuated in vivo, yet retained similar growth dynamics, stability, and virus titers in vitro when compared to the parental LaSota virus. Expression of the ILTV gB and gD proteins in the recombinant virus-infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence assay. Vaccination of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens with these recombinant viruses conferred significant protection against virulent ILTV and velogenic NDV challenges. Immunization of commercial broilers with rLS/ILTV-gB provided a similar level of protection against clinical disease as well as that provided by the live attenuated commercial vaccines (TCO and CEO), with no decrease in body weight gains. The results of the study suggested that the rLS/ILTV-gB and -gD viruses are safe, stable and effective bivalent vaccines that can be administered en mass via aerosol or drinking water to large chicken populations.

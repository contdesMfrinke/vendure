It assists in the restoration of Windows or the execution of system restore points. To use a recovery drive, you must first prepare an empty USB flash drive **(with a minimum of 16GB of space)** to create a Windows recovery drive. As Windows undergoes periodic updates to enhance security and device performance, it is recommended to periodically create a new recovery drive.
 
**Note**: When restoring the device via a recovery drive, the original disk partition data on the system drive may be deleted. (If your device supports MyASUS in WinRE or ASUS Recovery, functionalities built into the disk partitions on the system drive will be removed.) If you wish to preserve these functionalities, you can restore the device through a system image, thereby backing up the data in the disk partitions. Learn more about How to create and use Windows System Image to restore your device.

If you experience the device cannot boot, you can use the recovery drive to enter Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), and then restore from a system restore point or reinstall Windows via the recovery drive.

I've tried a few ways to do this. First, the Asus customer support website says to press F9 during boot to get to the recovery options. After following those instructions, I ultimately get the error message:
 
I've also tried running the Recovery app from Windows. This option will ask you a bunch of questions, then end up rebooting. When it does so, it just goes into the same Recovery mode that F9 gets you, with the same result.
 
This laptop is only a couple months old. It came with 8.0, the only thing I've done is ran the upgrade to 8.1. I didn't reformat, do a full install, or touch the partition table in any way. I simply did the upgrade. I can also see the Recovery partition in the disk manager:
 
One thing I've noticed is those recovery partitions are listed as 100% free. Does this mean I have a recovery partition, but it's just empty? If so, is there any way to restore this laptop to its factory settings short of sending it back to Asus? Thanks!
 
Our zenbook also crashed after installing 8.1. Asus repairer advised that the motherboard had to be replaced, which apparently is where the solid state drive is located, and presumably windows operating system and recovery partition. Asus help desk advised that 8.1 was unstable and could corrupt the bridge to recovery partition.I am going to stay with 8 and create my own shut down and start menus

If you don't want to use a third-party application to restore the Asus recovery partition automatically, you can try the following manual way to create a new recovery partition. Here, we take Windows 8 as an example.
 
**Step 3.** Find install.esd in the Sources folder. This is the recovery partition that is currently useless. Move it to a location on your hard disk.

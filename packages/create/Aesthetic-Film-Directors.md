Filmmaking is one of the few mediums that encapsulates a lot of different arts within itself, with each art form having a considerable depth of its own. The culmination of these different mediums eventually, in its primal state, culminates into a marriage of different elements, finally forming into our favorite film. Just as a painter has a distinct style by which he is known, similarly, a good filmmaker has a distinct visual style that separates him from the lot.

Plenty of directors have clearly identifiable styles. Everyone knows what a Tim Burton or a Michael Bay movie looks like. Yet these are the filmmakers who have a clear visual style where every frame feels like a work of art. Their films are unique to them and stand out amongst the crowd. Here are some of the most visually stylistic directors of all time, ranked.
 
**Nicolas Winding Refn** is known for his penchant for dark themes, juxtaposed with bright neon lights peppered with lush soundscapes. This interplay between neons and dark shades is present throughout most of his films like Drive, Only God Forgives and The Neon Demon.
 
**Jane Campion** is an inspiration to many aspiring filmmakers, especially female ones. She has caved the way for fellow passionate minds and leads with confidence rather than fear. The inspiration she brings to a project can undoubtedly be seen on screen. In one of her biggest successes, The Piano, her wide-ranged and dreamlike visions come to life in powerful shots. Campion stands out with her use of vast backgrounds, while still beautifully highlighting important details.
 
**Chlo Zhao** radiates dedication, creativity, and confidence wherever she goes. Even setbacks fail to shake her, as she keeps following her passion and continues to direct breathtaking movies. Zhao manages to unveil the layers of humanity in an incredibly soothing way and pairs various emotions with naturalistic elements. Her work inspires with handheld, picturesque shots and allows for a deep dive into someone else's story.

No other filmmaker lives and breathes his films as **Quentin Tarantino** does. Tarantino has such a distinctive personality that seeps into his films, almost making them a creative extension of who he is as a person and a filmmaker. Visually, Tarantino perpetually gets a kick out of blood and violence, staging the scene in a bid to spare nothing and nobody, including the audience. Apart from his staple wide shots that contain the majority of the bloodshed and violence, Tarantino has a distinctively appealing tight crash-zoom-in that he does, which has overtime become one of his most iconically signature shots.
 
**Amma Asante** rose to fame when her movie called Belle was released and instantly became a huge success. Asante is all about portraying meaningful visuals, which will have the audience contemplate about their meaning. It might be as subtle as a painting, such as in Belle, or more direct, like judgmental looks that are exchanged in A United Kingdom. Almost always used as a foundation are issues regarding race and political injustice.
 
**Greta Gerwig** has been in the business for multiple years already, but especially recently, her name has come up five times as much. The reason for that is her recent success with the live-action movie Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. A movie with such a huge fandom definitely needs someone who has the skills to meet high expectations, and Greta Gerwig clearly has those. While the director usually creates a more nostalgic style, she proves that she is confident and also creative enough to explore abstract elements such as in Barbie. Gerwig delivers dreamy visuals and shows no fear when it comes to extravagant colors.
 
The term "auteur" refers to filmmakers with a distinct approach to their craft that gives their films a personal and singular stamp. Many directors in the film industry, past and present, fall into this category. With their unique approach to filmmaking, usually displayed through technical or artistic elements, audiences can automatically tell who the filmmaker is just by looking at the screen. It cements these directors as visionaries who have almost become their own brand.
 
Guillermo del Toro is not only a champion in the advocation for cinema but one of the great visionaries working today. Del Toro is known for combining horror and fantasy in his films, giving birth to some truly memorable movie monsters. His films are artistically rich and detailed, featuring weird and wonderful characters and worlds. He often combines realistic themes with fantastical ones, proving that humans can be just as monstrous as the creatures he creates.
 
As one of the most prominent female voices in the film industry and an Oscar winner, Jane Campion is an artist in every sense of the word. Her films often use ambiguity to convey themes, which usually revolve around desire and madness. Visual metaphor and deep character psychology play a huge part, and she is known to challenge the male gaze. These elements are met with dream-like cinematography, which captures vast environments and landscapes.
 
When it comes to ambitious and epic sci-fi or fantasy films, Lily and Lana Wachowski are the most imaginative and daring. The pair used their experience as comic book writers to create visually inventive movies with detailed world-building and innovative action. While not all their films have been hits, each contains eye-popping CGI that brings their stories to life in an exciting and uniquely sensory way. Their best films have the perfect mix of thematic storytelling and groundbreaking VFX.
 
Regarding large-scale and intelligent sci-fi movies today, Denis Villeneuve is your guy. His films ignore classic Hollywood sci-fi conventions and are steeped in gritty realism. Taking influences from noir and crime films, his work features sleek production elements, which include roaring soundscapes and striking cinematography. His sci-fi stories are thought-provoking, focusing on narrative and atmosphere rather than explosive action.

If the look isn't your taste (too Pinterest-y, too overdone?), sure, I get that. But what I found myself bristling against was the knee-jerk reaction that because something looked nice, it was somehow automatically frivolous. And that is how I got to thinking about Nancy Meyers.
 
I could spend a much longer essay arguing about the merits of Nancy Meyers' films, aesthetics aside, discussing the ephemeral alchemy of writing and performances that makes an enjoyable movie. But why do I need to put aesthetics aside?
 
The women in Nancy Meyers' films are here for exactly none of that bullshit. They are established in their careers as playwrights or bakery owners or wedding dress designers, and they suffer no fools. Where Hollywood desexualizes and disposes of women over 40, Nancy Meyers celebrates them, showing them as women who have crushed their careers and become financially stable enough to buy objectively stunning pieces of property.
 
And at the heart of that property? The kitchen, the room of the home that was the historical prison for middle-class women. So yes, a Meyers woman has a double-range stove, the Sub-Zero fridge, the chrome accessories, and miles of island counter space to entertain her friends or unnaturally wholesome adult children. And yes, she'll find love with a devilishly handsome older man when she's not expecting it, and when she does, it'll be backdropped by immaculate lines and cream-colored cashmere. Why? Because, goddamn it, it looks good.
 
Film is an art form which combines many various disciplines and a good film is not necessarily a film that looks good. But there is no denying that film is first and foremost a visual medium and that making your movies look beautiful can never really be a bad thing.
 
Below you will find twenty directors who all have made various visually beautiful pieces of work. Some of them have very distinct visual styles, whereas others seem to vary the look of their movies significantly whilst still always keeping them visually impressive. And some of these movies are masterpieces, whilst others are a whole lot less successful. But the one thing they all have in common is that all of them have graced the screen with some awe-inspiring imagery.
 
The Beach was shot by Darius Khondji, a cinematographer who will be featured more on this list, and was bathed in lush colour and a kinetic visual style. Slumdog Millionaire was equally visually arresting and shot by Anthony Dod Mantle, who would again collaborate with Boyle and also make 127 Hours look quite spectacular, despite the fact that it was mostly set in one location.
 
Whilst the overall quality of the Matrix Trilogy is questionable (we all know the first one was incredible whilst the sequels were pretty hard to stomach), the visual style of all three movies certainly is not. Groundbreaking use of special effects might have been the key here (who can ever forget bullet time effects?) but the films green-tinted colour palette and original production design completed the package and sealed the deal.
 
The Wachowskis followed up their success with Speed Racer, a truly god-awful film, which nonetheless was a visual spectacle of the first order, provided you could sit through the vomit inducing hyper-kinetic and over-the-top candy-coloured whirlwind of images. The movie might have been a disaster on many levels but you sure as hell had never seen anything like it without the aid of drugs.

Monster Hunter Wilds is the next main series entry in the long-running and hugely successful Monster Hunter franchise. While Monster Hunter Rise was certainly popular, Monster Hunter Wilds is targeting newer hardware specifically, which should make it feel like more of a proper follow-up to Monster Hunter World.

Monster Hunter Wilds was first revealed at The Game Awards 2023 in a stunning trailer that, while impressive-looking, confirmed very little about the game. Now Capcom has given fans a much better idea of what they can expect from Monster Hunter Wilds come 2025, thanks to a new gameplay trailer revealed at the latest PlayStation State of Play event.
 
The Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailer showcases a huge graphical leap forward from Monster Hunter World, with significantly more detailed environments, monsters, and characters. The trailer shows Monster Hunter Wilds beasts that players will have to hunt, including a pack of bear-like monsters and an armored frog of sorts. As in previous games, Monster Hunter Wilds will have the monsters fighting each other occasionally, and players can also battle its fearsome creatures in co-op with friends. It remains to be seen exactly how co-op will work in the new game, but it does look like Monster Hunter World's SOS flares are making a comeback.
 
Speaking of Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Wilds will be doling out bonuses for those returning from that game. Those that have save data for Monster Hunter World will get the Felyne Leather Armor Set and the Felyne Acorn Spade Weapon. Those that have a save file for the Monster Hunter World: Iceborne expansion will additionally receive the Felyne Duffel Armor Set and Felyne Trekker Peckaxe Weapon.

Based on what's been shown so far, Monster Hunter Wilds is primed to be a big hit with fans of the franchise. Monster Hunter World was a massive success for Capcom and is indeed the company's best-selling game to date. Capcom clearly made a ton of new Monster Hunter fans with that entry, and so it will be hoping to bring them back for Monster Hunter Wilds. 2025 is shaping up to be an amazing year for gaming, and if huge new releases like Monster Hunter Wilds manage to stick the landing, next year should live up to the incredible hype and then some.
 
Also, my thoughts about the base Rise game itself are still pretty much the same as when I reviewed the original version in 2021 so feel free to check my Monster Hunter Rise Switch review for a more thorough take on things like mechanics, monsters and other features.
 
I played the game on my ginormous 82-inch TV, which is usually great at magnifying visual flaws, and the PS5 version of Monster Hunter Rise looks like a champ. The graphics look nice and crisp, especially the character and monster models, and the backgrounds and textures also look good.
 
Granted, the game is not quite as detailed as Monster Hunter World and Iceborne but that has more to do with Rise itself as the game was originally developed for the Nintendo Switch. While Rise performs phenomenally for a Switch game, certain sacrifices had to be made to make that possible and that means less complex environmental details.
 
Even more important, at least for me, is the frame rate and Monster Hunter Rise on PS5 performs well in that regard, thankfully. The game just felt buttery smooth, which is great news for hunters who rely heavily on proper timing. This is Monster Hunter after all, so any weapon benefits from good timing but this is especially true for any weapon that uses counters and guard points.
 
This is especially true for someone like me who played Monster Hunter Rise not just once from the beginning but twice. I invested hundreds of hours on the Switch version, for example, after Rise first launched. And then I had to redo all that from the start once again when the Sunbreak expansion came out because the only copy available for reviewers was the PC version and I ended up investing hundreds of hours in the PC version as well. By the way, the Sunbreak expansion will also be coming out for PS5 and other consoles sometime this spring.
 
I just hope that cross play or at least cross saves will be an option in the next new Monster Hunter game whenever that comes out, at least for PC and PS5. I mean, if they can make it work for Xbox platforms and PC, then it should be possible for PS5 as well given how its architecture is closer to PC than, say, the PS3.
 
Looking to restore your lost Monster Hunter save files? Let's help you find out how. The Monster Hunter series is a beloved video game franchise that has been around for over 15 years. It has continued to evolve and grow in popularity, with new games being released yearly. The games feature a unique blend of action and adventure.
 
But, issues arise when players lose their progress and look to **recover Monster Hunter game save**. So, if you're looking to restore either Monster Hunter: Rise or Monster Hunter World save file deleted, let's show you how.
 
The Monster Hunter series is one of the world's most popular video game franchises. It's a beloved franchise for many gamers, and it's not uncommon for players to lose their game data due to technical issues.
 
Fortunately, there are ways to recover Monster Hunter game saves and data if they become lost or deleted. In this article, we'll explore how you can recover your Monster Hunter data and save files if they have been deleted or lost.
 
Professional recovery software is the first method to use in Monster Hunter data recovery. You need something that helps you recover the Monster Hunter World save files that are deleted. Use EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard in this method.
 
EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard is an outstanding data recovery tool that allows users to recover lost or deleted data from their hard drives. It supports all storage devices, including internal and external hard drives, memory cards, and USB flash drives.
 
With its intuitive interface and powerful features, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard makes it easy for anyone to recover their lost or deleted files in no time at all. Besides that, it offers amazing features such as:
 
**Step 1.**Run EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. Choose the drive where you lost files and start scanning by clicking "Search for Lost Data". This software allows you to recover lost data from all devices, including HDD, SSD, USB drive, SD card, pen drive, camera, etc.
 
**Step 2.**Browse the full scan results. You can choose the file type you need by clicking on the file type filter. EaseUS data recovery software supports 1000+ file types like photos, videos, documents, emails, audio files, and many more.
 
The second method is to use Steam Cloud to recover lost files. Steam usually has a backup cloud for all the games, which allows you to synchronize it with your computer. So, in the event that you lose your saved files, all you'll have to do is sync the two again.
 
It's important to understand that instead of Your User Number, It will be a series of digits in the aforementioned directory. So, make sure you head into that folder. Now, you can start the Monster Hunter: World or Rise to see the restored progress.
 
In this step, we will recover the Monster Hunter game files through the local directory. However, first, we need to disable the Steam Cloud sync or see if it's already disabled. So, if the previous method didn't work, you'll try this:
 
These are some leading ways to restore your deleted Monster Hunter game saves. Using these methods doesn't only virtually guarantee that you'll restore the saved files but also allows you to do it comprehensively and quickly. Hence, it's important that you follow each method properly.
 
However, if you're looking to ensure a thorough recovery, then it's suggested that you try EaseUS data recovery software. Because if the file is lost from both the local directory and the steam cloud, it's the only way you can recover it.
 
When you're running around on missions you'll be picking up everything in sight (which just so happens to be one of our tips, as you'll find out if you just keep on reading). Why not get rewarded for it at the same time? Go to the hub in Astera and head towards the Resource Center, where you can gather up a ton of bounties that just require you to collect a set amount of items, kill some beasts, or investigate a specific monster. Ticking these off comes naturally when you're wandering around in the wild, so just remember to turn them in after every quest and stock up on new ones.
 
Missions usually have a time limit. Which are super fun when you've almost killed your quarry but can literally see the seconds ticking away before your very eyes. However, expeditions let you roam free without any restriction on how long you spend out in the open. That makes them perfect for fighting monsters at your own leisure, gathering resources, or simply exploring the maps at your own pace.

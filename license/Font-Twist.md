A coworker has a drawing he's twisted 90 degrees with DVIEW. As a result some of the linetypes with text are upside down. Any ideas how to resolve this? I've tried REVERSE but that didn't rotate the text.
 
I have the same issue. I am dview/twisting my viewport so that north points more or less south. I can rotate my text and multileaders, and can switch from left to right or right to left my dimension texts, but all linetypes show upside down. I cannot reverse them, I cannot draw them the other direction, I cannot rotate them.

This issue may have nothing to do with the .LIN file. I recently received a .DGN that I converted to .DWG and some linetypes appeared mirrored. I did UCS > OBject and click on the beginning of the line. The result was an upside down ucs. It's almost like these lines were drawn from below, looking up.

The Twist font is a bold typeface with a playful appearance. I tried to combine 2 fonts inspired by TV broadcasts, mid-century storybooks. It is suitable for broadcast, labels, logos, magazines, clothing and other commercial purposes. You can choose from three styles, regular, round, and rough, so you can get the retro/modern look you want

I have tried two methods to no avail. First I tried Presets -> Numbers and masked off the unwanted timecode values. Then I tried Motion Boutique's Timer Script. The problem with both of these methods are that the timer counts up automatically as the video plays.
 
I'm simulating a timeline in an app and when the timeline is scrubbed to the **right**, I'd like the timer to decrease in value. And when the timeline is scrubbed to the **left,** I'd like the timer to increase in value. Please see screenshot below.
 
1. here's an animation preset I made for a Timer\* where you have HH:MM:SS values in Sliders on a text layer. just create a text layer, use a monospaced font, and apply the preset (animation->apply animation preset):
 
There are hundreds of different ways to make timers. I use a variation on Dan Ebert's universal up down clock. Start time is driven by a layer marker, all of the options are controlled by Expression Controls check-boxes and sliders.
 
Effects>Text>Timecode should do the trick. Set the TimeSource property to Custom. Then keyframe the value for Custom>TimeUnits to offset the natural time increment of AE's Timeline or to any value you require.
 
Not with this effect. BTW, I've just checked Effects>Text>Numbers and there seems to be a bug with the property Value/Offset/RandomMax not being functional when a negative value is input. The result when a negative value is input is as if only the positive variant of the number is being calculated. Please file a bug; using the Feature Request/Bug Report link at the top of this Forum's Main Page. Thanks.
 
\*the only issue I currently see with this preset is that it does not work well with negative numbers (which I discovered by testing for your post, not that I ever needed it..) and I do plan to see how to work around it.
 
Just re-discovered the Expression Method **timeToTimecode**. This works with the text formatting currently applied to a Text Layer and works with negative time and negative input values.
 
The isDuration argument, which defaults to false, should be true if the t value represents a difference between two times instead of an absolute time. Absolute times are rounded down toward negative infinity; durations are rounded away from zero (up for positive values).

A preposition is a word that shows position or direction or introduces a prepositional phrase. It expresses relation to another word in the clause. A preposition always precedes a noun to show the noun's relationship to another word in the sentence. The word or phase that the preposition introduces is called the object of the preposition. Common prepositions include (up, around, under, over, above, besides, between etc...) Learn more about prepositions by using our free prepositions worksheets below.

**Prepositions are words that express locations in time and space.** They indicate relationships between nouns and other words. Learning prepositions is cornerstone to understanding the English language. Since prepositions are used quite frequently, it is worth taking the time to learn them.
 
It's often said that one shouldn't end one's sentences with a preposition. Most grammarians now agree that this is NOT a rule but a signal. There is nothing wrong with ending a clause or sentence with a preposition, but it's often an indication that the preposition is redundant or unnecessary. For example: Where did you go to school at?
 
This is grammatically incorrect, not because it ends with a preposition, but because the preposition is redundant. The example sentence should just say, Where did you go to school? The preposition at adds nothing to the sentence. It is unnecessary and should be removed. So while there is nothing wrong with ending a sentence with a preposition, it is often a signal that your preposition is redundant. **Try to avoid constructing sentences with redundant prepositions**.

1. **Practice Use:** Hold a book above a desk. Ask students where the book is. Hold the book below the desk. Ask students to describe where the book is in relation to the desk. Move the book on the side of the desk, behind the desk, and in front of the desk, asking students to describe the location of the book in relation to the desk. Make the connection that prepositions are words that show location. Do a similar activity with their class period in relation to their lunch period to show how prepositions express time relations as well.
  
2. **The Poser Game:** Have one student leave the room. Have another student volunteer get up and hold a crazy pose, like a statue. Students should use prepositions to describe, with as much detail as possible, how the student is positioned. Then, the student on the outside is invited back into the classroom. Students try to have the new arrival replicate the pose of the former based on their descriptions.

**Prepositions Lesson** - Here is an animated PowerPoint slideshow covering prepositions. It provides definitions, examples, and practice problems. There are two versions of this presentation: one with sounds and one without. The one with sounds has voice actors reading the examples. Some students may find this distracting, however, so I have also included a version of this lesson without sounds. Would you like to see how I present this lesson?

Here is an example of a prepositional phrase acting as an adjective: the dog in that yard belongs to Bill. This sentence shows us that the prepositional phrase, in the yard, is acting as the adjective which describes the dog. With this worksheet, students will be asked to underline the prepositional phrases acting as adjectives, and to circle the words modified by those prepositional phrases.
 
There are two options for each of the prepositions of place, one with a ball and one with a rabbit. There are not that many preopisitions for placement and so using both the 'rabbit' version and 'ball' version together should fill up your worksheets. The prepositions of movement images also have 2 versions. The ones labeled 'move\_ ...' are just a ball and block format. There are other verbs and dipictions labeled with the actual verb, 'run\_ ...' for example.

Below we review what a preposition is, how it can be used, when it is acceptable to end a sentence with one, and how to make corrections when it may be frowned upon. Use these rules and examples to ensure your writing is clear and concise.
 
A preposition is a word or group of words that show direction, time, location, place, spatial relationships, or introduce an object. They are relationship words used before a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun and are crucial for effective communication.
 
Informal settings allow for prepositional endings in conversation and writing. You most likely already do it when speaking to friends and family or in a casual atmosphere. It might also sound awkward not to use a preposition at the end, making it acceptable in this scenario as well.
 
When speaking or writing to people you may not know for work or school assignments, it is best to take a more formal approach and avoid end of sentence prepositional use. When proofreading and editing these types of examples, consider moving prepositions within the sentences.
 
The audience usually determines formal writing. If you are writing for work, an event, or to people you want to communicate clearly and concisely to, avoid the informal tone suggested with the placement of prepositions at the end of a sentence.
 
A passive voice in writing occurs when you might not know the subject of a sentence, or who is performing an action. It ends in a preposition and is easy to correct. However, there is nothing wrong with using it, even though traditional grammarians consider it a no-no. Just be sure that you have no other way to clarify the sentence without it sounding awkward.
 
Although we use many prepositions in everyday language, some of the most common ones make their way to the end of a sentence. This use is often casual and works to help a sentence flow. However, you want to avoid their use in formal settings if you can. Also, look for unnecessary use even in an informal situation, and correct the sentence for clarity.
 
Which is the part of speech that indicates location, position, direction, time and spatial relationship? It is the prepositions. This article gives you some exercises on prepositions to help you check your understanding of their usage. Try them out and also check your answers to find out if you have got it right.
 
On a very hot and sunny day, a thirsty crow was flying in search of water. Due to the hot weather, most of the ponds had dried up. Suddenly, he saw a vessel on the ground. When he flew towards it, he saw there was very little water at the bottom of the vessel. While thinking about how he could drink that water, he saw little pebbles lying around. He started dropping them one by one into the vessel. After some time, the water level rose. The thirsty crow quenched its thirst and flew away happily.
 
This next set of exercises will help you properly learn and practice German prepositions. In particular, you will learn and practice prepositions of place and the use of the prepositions "aus", "von", "nach" and "zu". This is important, since German language learners often mix up the prepositions "aus" and "von" and the prepositions "zu" and "nach.". Keep in mind, for example, that if you want to say that you come from (are a native of) a country, you would say, "Ich komme aus Deutschland", whereas if you are coming from one destination to another you would say, for example, "Ich fahre von Bonn nach Koeln."
 
You will also find exercises to help you learn accusative, dative, and two-way prepositions. Although prepositions will not change with case like adjectives or nouns, there are some prepositions which will require the noun to take the accusative case, others the dative case and still others will take either case depending on how they are used.

- The accusative prepositions are durch, fuer, ge

It is a docudrama about Ekta, a young agricultural scientist realising problems within the current model of agriculture research, regulation and practice and the way farming is pushed into crisis and food production and consumption gets into a vicious poisonous cycle. Further, she explores ways to find solutions in working with farmers for the agrarian crisis and farmer suicide happening in our country.
 
The film is presented by Development Dialogue, a forum to dialogue about the ways of addressing the development challenges we are facing. The crowdfunding campaign for the movie was started on 16 December, 2016 and ended in the month of February, 2017. It started its first shoot schedule on 11 Feb 2017. The campaign was supported by 120 individuals and organisations who are concerned about the plight of the farmers, like Dinesh Chandrashekar, Suresh Ediga, SAHE, Rural hope foundation.
 
Cinema as a medium of communication works wonders when utilised in the proper way. Sinha has made the best possible use of the forum by giving voice to the several voiceless farmers who are drowning in debts and have no choice left in front of them but to commit suicide. They are victims of chemical farming and are on the verge of losing their job which is also their identity. Sinha hopes that it reaches a large audience and is successful in sensitizing them on the issue it focuses on.

Smells, as an experience, aren't permission based. They are perceived as the autonomic result of breathing. We neurologically detect smells before we can describe them and it happens in a flash. Molecules that comprise smells make physical contact with olfactory receptors, generating memories and emotions before they can be expressed as language. James McHugh captures the liminal quality of smell when he writes: "Smell has the strange, almost paradoxical, nature of being both a remote sense and a contact sense."
 
"In my childhood, one smell that affected me the most was the scent of the earth when it rained for the first time after a hot summer. The smell was so subtle that sometimes I wondered if it existed at all.
 
With it, memories of my childhood also came back, not as one particular incident, but as various assorted images. I saw myself going back to school in a horse-cart, my mother teaching at the same school, the school that was close to the border.
 
There were a few destroyed tanks and bunkers, reminiscent of old wars. The broken tanks and bunkers had gathered dust, colorful flowers grew on them. Rain fell on those flowers and gave out the same scent.
 
The shopkeeper told me that this scent was made in Kannauj, where they have been making it for centuries. What fascinated me was the scent, which I even failed to spell out, was experienced by someone in ancient India, who tried to capture it and succeeded!
 
The duality of terrestrial experience (the smell of rain on parched earth) and the ability to distill the terrestrial (sandalwood and shards of fired earthen clay) bookend the narrator's sense of wonder at the close of the film. *The Scent of Earth* is a filmic ode to its namesake. What we are left with is proof that the extraordinary can be found in something as ordinary as dry earth that crumbles between the fingers like dust, and smells of the heavens in the rain.
 
This documentary film is directed by Award Winning Social Filmmaker Anshul Sinha who won 140 awards for his prior documentaries and it is based on the research done by Agriculture Scientist Dr. G.V.Ramanjaneyulu.

The Indian cinema has also successfully been able to showcase the relationship of soil with a farmer. The mitti is a source of income for the agriculturists and any harm to it uproots their entire life. This is portrayed in movies like Peepli Live ( 2010) and Lagaan ( 2001). In both movies, the farmers are suffering because of the drought and have to fight for the protection of their livelihood. Lagaan is based in the colonial period when the government is charging extra dues even during a period of drought leading to a conflict eventually being solved through a match of cricket. Peepli Live on the other hand is a satire that highlights the problem of increasing numbers of suicides among the farmers due to the drying up of land. It must be remembered that these are only 2 examples among several movies on this topic. Despite the increasing problems of land for the agriculturists, they continue to worship their karm bhumi and also vow to protect it with their life.
 
Although the discussion here has highly revolved around mainstream Indian cinema but there has also been a rise in the number of documentaries and alternative cinema which focuses on the conservationist aspect of mitti. The soil which has constantly been a national symbol is now also seen as an element itself that has been damaged due to the progressive activities of humans. In a way, now the responsibility of protecting dharti maa is on every Indian by making sustainable choices.
 
The relationship between Bollywood and mitti cannot be easily broken off. It has played a huge role in not only creating a patriotic feeling but also drawing the audience. There have been discussions around the over-commercializing of this feeling as a way to lure people toward a narrative. Despite all that, mitti, as a word and as a feeling has become an integral part of Bollywood movies.

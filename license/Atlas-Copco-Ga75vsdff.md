My name is rich, mechanic at a taylor rental center and we have a atlas copco tow behind model xas 96 jd screw type comp. that is blowing the safety valve and getting quite a bit of oil blowing out of the lines.
 
In the small tank/air receiver inside your compressor is a filter, called the oil separator. The separators job is to separate the oil from the air, so only air is blown out and the oil stays inside the compressor.

The other thing is that the scavenge line could be plugged with dirt. The oil separator works by making big oil drops from smaller oil drops (simply said)... the oil drops collect at the bottom of the separator.
 
If the flexible hose, or the pipe (inside the air vessel) is plugged, it will not work anymore and the oil will not be sucked away, but instead it will leave your compressor together with the compressed air.
 
So, what you have to do: open up the vessel inside your compressor. Inspect both the oil separator filter and the scavenge line. You should be able to blow through the scavenge line by mouth (watch the oil ;) ..
 
These portable air compressors should be stopped as follows: during running, close all the oulet valves. The compressor will now go to unload and minimum speed. Wait for a minute or a few minutes. Shut down the compressor.
 
Hello, I have and atlas copco XAS 185 KD7. When air valves are closed tank psi is 125. If I open them gradually and keep tank psi 90 or above everthing is good. Whith the valves wide open tank psi drops to 50 and oil is blowing out of the lines. What do think the possible cause could be. Thanks Gene

SO I've been online for more than 2 hours trying to figure this out. Reading forums and going thru Stackflow, CodePen, Jfiddle, all of it. And I can't seem to center this div in between two elements floated left and right on either side. All I want to do is put three Divs in a row. 1.....2....3 in a row. It sounds super easy but for some reason I can't quite find the answer anywhere. Reaching out here to see if anyone can help. Things I've done so far:
 
^^This appears to work at first but once I try to put margins around the body to add room on the sides, the inside Div seems to be getting squished in and the bottom height seem to increase and doesn't align with my left or right div. I've also tried the margin: 0 auto guy and it doesn't quite work.
 
The important parts here are the display, flex-direction and justify content properties. display: flex turns the container into a flex container and all of the child elements inside of it into flex items. flex-direction: row makes the divs side by side as a row instead of on top of each other as a column, which you can see if you change it to flex-direction: column. And justify-content: space-between distributes space evenly between the divs.
 
This was a really simple example and you can find a cheat sheet here: -tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ for more properties, but again I would recommend going through the flexbox course here.

Our side-by-side lineup gives you an answer to every off road situation. The Defender brings brawn to the work day. The Maverick R was built to conquer the desert and already won its first race. And the Commander can do it all.
 
In Notepad++ 5.7 you can right-click on a tab and select "**Move to Other View**". You can also select "**Clone to Other View**" if you want to have the same file open more than once and see different parts of it. You can right-click the divider line and rotate the views to be either side-by-side or top-and-bottom.
 
As well as moving or cloning the document to a separate view pane, you might want them to scroll together too, in a truly "side by side" manner. This makes it much easier to perform line-by-line comparison, for instance.
 
To reduce the felt recoil and muzzle-flip in a side-by-side, as well as improve its pointability, I recommend shooting with a much straighter lead-arm than you would with an over-under (see images overleaf). Indeed, if you held the fore-end of the side-by-side with your lead-hand, the gun would invariably feel short, and as a result you would have less control of the gun. So, not only does the straight arm absorb recoil (rather than your shoulder), but it also gives you greater control of the barrels and therefore improves your accuracy and precision.
 
In a similar way, the Prince of Wales, semi-pistol and full pistol grips, typically found on over-unders, in effect keep the grip-hand locked in place at the start of the mount, during the mount and when you take the shot, giving you greater consistency. Your arms also take out a lot of recoil and these grips help to absorb felt recoil.
 
But in terms of traditional low-ground partridges and pheasants, or driven grouse, a traditional side-by-side is still a wonderful and effective tool for the job. The wider barrel profile can actually be an advantage on a grouse moor or with low partridges over hedgerows as it is easier to pick up and gauge the true line of the bird.

I would like to have a second dataframe on the right of the first one. There is a similar question, but it looks like there a person is satisfied either with merging them in one dataframe of showing the difference between them.
 
To display two DataFrames side by side you must use set\_table\_attributes with the argument "style='display:inline'" as suggested in ntg answer. This will return two Styler objects. To display the aligned dataframes just pass their joined HTML representation through the display\_html method from IPython.
 
Here's another variation of the display\_side\_by\_side() function introduced by @Anton Golubev that combines gibbone (to set styles and captions) and stevi (adding space), I added an extra argument to change spacing between tables at run-time.
 
I decided to add some extra functionality to Yasin's elegant answer, where one can choose both the number of cols **and** rows; any extra dfs are then added to the bottom.Additionally one can choose in which order to fill the grid (simply change fill keyword to 'cols' or 'rows' as needed)
 
The next graphic artist who answers this in a simple, understandable way for a non-graphic person will be the first. I have the entire Creative Cloud at my disposal and just want to place one photo on the left, and one photo on the right. I would like cleft and right photos to be in one .PNG. Like the most basic-ass collage in collageable. From what I've been able to ascertain, there is no easy way to do this for basic ass people like myself in the entire Creative Cloud.
 
@Christopher25956384ujld, you have posted in the Photoshop Elements forum. Elements is not part of the Creative Cloud. Although the same basic principles apply for creating a collage in both programs, IMO Elements actually has an easier method. I will move your post to the correct Photoshop Ecosystem forum and hopefully you will get what you need there.
 
You obviously have experience in talking to graphically challenged people because even \*I\* understood this and even if I didn't, the video would seal the deal. Thank you! One other thing I forgot to mention is I would preferably like to do this on my iPad for mobility reasons and for someone not versed in graphic design, all I see are 50 buttons on the left and right.
 
Is doing the same video on the iPad even possible? I realize there's a lot of dragging and dropping that maybe the iPad can't accommodate. But if there's any way you could explain it there too you would officially achieve God status.
 
I acknowledge it's not easy to know something inside out but then try and explain it to noobs. For me, it's driving stick (Gen Z..."huh?"). But I can drive stick shift (manual transmission) in my sleep but if I had to explain it to someone else who doesn't know what a clutch is, it's challenging. So what I'm saying is thanks for explaining it in a way (3 steps!) even the most graphically challenged can grasp. Thank you also to the first person who weighed in as I'd like to try that way too...it may be the exact same way I don't know yet.
 
Photoshop on Mac and Windows can also work similarly; instead of drag-and-drop importing you can choose File > Place Embedded or File > Place Linked and select a photo from a folder. On Photoshop for iPad, the Import Photos button is the same as the File > Place Embedded command in Mac and Windows.
 
"Some babies find it soothing to shake their head from side to side. They may do this when they are overstimulated, anxious, or trying to fall asleep. Self-soothing is harmless and may help a baby feel less anxious in new situations."
 
So if your baby has any symptoms you're concerned about, it's always worth checking in with the GP. But head-shaking can also be perfectly normal in young babies, so if your little one has no other symptoms, there's probably no need to worry.
 
Yes. My son is 4 months and he does this. And he moves alot. Kicking legs and arms then it stops. They say baby reflux REM. He doesn't do it when he's sleeping on me. Maybe it's some type of separation anxiety.
 
Meeting and webinar participants who are viewing a shared screen can switch to side-by-side mode, which allows them to see the shared screen alongside Speaker, Gallery, or Multi-speaker view, depending on which view they choose. They can also adjust the location of the separator between the shared screen and video to change the relative size of each side.
 
Upon leaving side-by-side mode, video thumbnails are displayed either above the content when in windowed mode (similar to speaker view) or over the content in the top-right corner of the screen when in fullscreen. These thumbnails during fullscreen can be moved by clicking and dragging. 

 
Use a different app on one side: Click the app window, move the pointer over the green button in the top-left corner, choose Replace Tiled Window, then click the window you want to use instead. If you decide not to replace the current window, click the desktop to return to it.

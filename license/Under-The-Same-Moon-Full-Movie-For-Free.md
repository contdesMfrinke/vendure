As a part of their weekly calls, Rosario describes the area around the payphone to Carlitos in detail. Meanwhile, Carlitos lives in his hometown with his ill grandmother. On the day of his ninth birthday party, his aunt and uncle try to take custody of him to take the money Rosario sends to him every month. His Grandmother turns down their offer and assures Carlitos that she will keep him with her. Later the same night, she dies in her sleep.

Soon after his grandmother dies, Carlitos finds the coyotes and pays them to get him across the border, using money he had saved over the years from both his mother's payments and his part-time job. After crossing the border, the coyotes are stopped for other offenses (several hundred dollars in unpaid parking tickets and expired tags), and their car is towed away with Carlitos still inside. At night, Carlitos escapes the vehicle and runs off but unwittingly drops his money.
 
Carlitos reaches a bus station but can't buy a ticket because he is too young. Carlitos asks a man if he could buy him a ticket. Carlitos then realizes that he has lost his money. He offers the man $100 to drive him to the impound lot, but when they arrive at the impound lot, Carlitos can't find the money. The man, upset, tries to sell Carlitos to a pimp. A local woman, Reyna witnesses the exchange and takes Carlitos to live and work with other undocumented immigrants, but not before scolding the men and throwing money at the man who had attempted to sell Carlitos. The next day, while working, immigration police raid the building and arrest most of the workers. Carlitos and another worker named Enrique, who does not like Carlitos, escape.

Carlitos begins to follow Enrique as he leaves the farm. Enrique tells him to leave him alone and that he doesn't want to watch over him and not to follow him. Carlitos follows him anyway, and the two eventually end up hitchhiking to the city limits of Tucson. When they get out of the van, Enrique yells at Carlitos again for following him and tells the boy to go, so Carlitos begins to walk off in anger on his own. Enrique sees that some men are about to jump Carlitos to try and steal his backpack, and decides to save Carlitos.
 
Carlitos manages to gain employment for both Enrique and himself at the restaurant. While at the restaurant, Carlitos looks up his absent father, Oscar Aguilar Pons, and they meet. Oscar agrees to take Carlitos to Rosario, but later doesn't show, apparently having changed his mind, angering Carlitos. Enrique decides to take Carlitos to Los Angeles. The two take a bus ride and reach LA.
 
Carlitos and Enrique arrive in East LA at the address, only to find a PO box. Carlitos and Enrique decide to search the city for the payphone her mother calls from. After a day of unsuccessful searching, the two rest on a bench.
 
Then, Doa Carmen calls Rosario, letting her know that Carlitos crossed the border and that her mother is dead. Rosario decides to go back to Mexico to search for Carlitos, believing him to be deported, as she thinks Carlitos has no idea where to find her. When boarding the bus she sees a little boy at a payphone out the window of the bus at the bus station, and she realizes that Carlitos does know where to find her.
 
In the morning, Enrique and Carlitos get surprised by a pair of police officers, and Enrique, noticing that Carlitos is about to be apprehended, throws his coffee at the cops to distract them. Enrique shouts to Carlitos to run away, which he is able to do, but Enrique is arrested, sacrificing his freedom.
 
Carlitos finally finds the payphone. They see each other across the street. Rosario yells to her son not to cross yet. The crosswalk light turns from the "red hand" light to the white figure walking" light, indicating that Carlitos and his mom will finally reunite.
 
In *Under the Same Moon*, Riggen helps to show the power of determination. The character of Rosario displays many underlying feminist themes, since she is fighting for success for her family almost completely by herself. In Los Angeles, she experiences difficulties with finding work but keeps persevering so that she can see Carlos again. Additionally, the theme of determination can be seen in the way that Rosario is determined to find true love. When Paco proposes, she initially does not comply because she is determined to save her marriage for someone she is truly in love with.
 
Carlos also is determined to reunite with his mother again, which essentially drives the entire plot of the film. He faces many challenges on his journey, yet continues the journey because his sight is set on Los Angeles and his mother.
 
The theme of love is a central theme of the film as well. There is a sense of universal love in the sense that complete strangers, such as Enrique, sacrifice themselves for the love of others. Additionally, the closing scene of the reunion shows how the power of love is what led to the reunion of Rosario and Carlos. Riggen shows the challenges that immigration brings about, yet how love can overcome borders. In the end, love makes people move mountains.
 
The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, getting a 73% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads, "If *Under the Same Moon* is often manipulative, it is also heartfelt, and features strong performances from its leads."[2] On Metacritic, 24 critics gave the film 59/100, meaning "mixed or average" reviews.[3]
 
The experiences Carlitos goes through, such as navigating grief, being abandoned by coyotes (smugglers), and relying on the kindness of strangers, seem almost impossible to believe. La Misma Luna provides a refreshing angle on how people view immigration. This film does something remarkable and allows viewers to attach a story to the immigrant experience and hardships. I felt how effortlessly through its narrative, the film teaches viewers to be selfelss and follow dreams bigger than themselves.
 
The first thing I did when I got home was tell my parents about the truly transformative experience I had in my English class and, of course, look all over YouTube for the movie I spent all evening talking about. As my parents watched, I noticed their eyes get watery at the exact same moments mine were. We did not have to say anything to understand what we felt.
 
Inspired by the Canadian Shield landscape, artist Ileana Grimm came up with the idea for these Canadiana images while gazing up at the moon. As humans, "we have many more similarities than differences," says Grimm "and we all live under the same moon."
 
Miles may separate you from your little one, but no matter where you are, you're both looking up at the same moon.

The first real tear-jerker of 2008 is here and it's called **La Misma Luna** (**Under the Same Moon**). That "same moon" is the one under which both Rosario, a young mother working in Los Angeles and Carlitos, her nine year old son back in Mexico, both sleep. It's the moon they both look at knowing the other is also looking. It's a way they have to connect with each other between their weekly Sunday morning phone calls. At times, it is the only hope they have of ever seeing each other again.
 
The problem, of course, is immigration. Rosario has come to the United States illegally in hopes of making some money and, ultimately, gaining legal status and then sending for her son. Carlitos, meanwhile, has been stuck in Mexico living with his grandmother (his father took off before he was born and we find out is living in Tucson).
 
As is the way in these kinds of films, adversity strikes. Two days after Carlitos' birthday, his grandmother dies, leaving the young boy alone. He decides he's had enough and in the next five days, before his next scheduled call, he's going to go to LA and find his mom. Written out like that, this seems an improbable tale at best. And yet, in the hands of first time feature director Patricia Riggen, the film not only works, but comes off as believable.
 
A good portion of that credit, though, must also go to Adrian Alonso, who, at 13, plays the nine-year-old Carlitos with a heart and energy unmatched by many Hollywood actors twice his age. He is able to convey his emotions and determination beautifully, never stooping (unless intentionally) into small child doe-eyes. He is a three dimensional character who has a drive and the will to succeed. He is aided on his journey by Enrique (Eugenio Derbez, one of Mexico's finest actors) also an illegal who is slowly won over. The fact Enrique does not immediately fall for the charms of the kid is a tribute to the skill of writer Ligiah Villalobos. By the time he does come around it feels natural and right. As if he was convinced by the situation and not coerced by the needs of the story.
 
As Rosario, Kate del Castillo is given less to do physically, but shoulders a large percentage of the emotional weight of the film. It is through her eyes we see the plight of the domestic illegal and the hardships endured in the name of a promise of a better life. While her son and his friend travel, Rosario stagnates and her internal struggle to do what is right almost leads her to disaster.
 
A lot will be said about this film in reference to illegal immigration. While it is true all of the characters in it have entered the United States under less than perfect circumstances, this is not what the film is about. At no point do Villalobos or Riggen pros

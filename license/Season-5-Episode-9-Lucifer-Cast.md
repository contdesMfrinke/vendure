Jerry Bruckheimer Television, DC Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Television served as producers. Filming took place primarily in Vancouver before production was relocated entirely to Los Angeles at the start of the third season. The first season received mixed reviews from critics, and its original broadcaster Fox canceled it after three seasons in May 2018. One month later, Netflix picked up the show following the fanbase's campaign to save it, and the series continued for a further three seasons; it consistently earned high viewership during its time on Netflix.[3]
 
The second season premiered on September 19, 2016. Initially consisting of 13 episodes,[22] the series later received a 9-episode extension for a full 22-episode second-season pickup by Fox.[23] The third season, initially consisting of 22 episodes, premiered on October 2, 2017.[24][25] However, the final four episodes of the second season were removed and placed in the third season to air, resulting in the second season consisting of 18 episodes and the third season of 26.[26][27] Writer Chris Rafferty indicated that the third season would instead contain 24 episodes, and the extra 2 episodes would be held for the fourth season.[28]
 
On May 11, 2018, Fox canceled the series after three seasons, stating it was a "ratings-based decision". The 2 episodes being held for the fourth season were put as "bonus episodes" at the end of the third season;[29][30][31] they were broadcast on May 28, as a single two-hour bonus episode.[21]
 
On June 18, Netflix picked up the series for a fourth season of ten episodes, which was released on May 8, 2019.[32][33][34] Netflix renewed the series for a fifth (and originally final) season of sixteen episodes,[35][36] in two batches consisting of 8 episodes each.[37] The first 8 episodes were released on August 21, 2020,[38] and the second 8 episodes were released on May 28, 2021.[39] The series was later renewed for a sixth and final season of 10 episodes,[40][41] which was released on September 10, 2021.[42]
 
In an interview, actress Lesley-Ann Brandt stated that production for the fifth season was "99% finished", with production all completed except for half of the final episode before suspending production due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[48][49] Production resumed on September 24, 2020, to finish the final episode of the fifth season and begin production of the sixth season.[50][51]
 
In February 2015, Tom Ellis was cast as Lucifer Morningstar, while Tom Kapinos was attached to write the pilot, directed by Len Wiseman.[4] Approximately one month after, Lauren German was cast as LAPD-detective Chloe Decker.[52] Lina Esco was originally cast as Maze (Mazikeen),[53] but the role was later recast with Lesley-Ann Brandt.[9] Kevin Alejandro portrayed Dan.[54] The following year in June, Tricia Helfer was cast as Lucifer and Amenadiel's mother, Charlotte, and she was to appear in multiple episodes in the second season.[55] The character was promoted to series regular in July.[56] Aimee Garcia was also cast as a regular in the second season, playing L.A.P.D.'s forensic scientist Ella Lopez.[57] In August, Michael Imperioli was cast as angel Uriel.[58] For the fourth season, Graham McTavish and Inbar Lavi were cast as Father Kinley and Eve respectively.[59][60] For season 5, Tom Ellis was also cast as Michael, Lucifer's twin brother with "a chip on his shoulder" and Matthew Bohrer was cast as Donovan Glover, a character who appeared in only one episode.[61]
 
Although the pilot was shot on location in Los Angeles, the rest of the first season and the entirety of the second were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, with some exterior filming in Los Angeles. Production relocated to California beginning with the third season,[64] taking advantage of tax incentives provided by the California Film Commission under its "Program 2.0" initiative[65] and spending $92.1 million on production.[66] Season four was also shot on location in Los Angeles, as well as at Warner Bros.' Burbank studio lot,[67] spending $35.8 million on production.[68]
 
The opening theme is a six-second clip from "Being Evil Has a Price", performed by the band Heavy Young Heathens.[69] In a lawsuit filed against Warner Bros., the song's composers, Robert and Aron Marderosian, claim the song has been used without giving them proper credit or a licensing agreement.[70]

Several episodes include musical performances by Tom Ellis, although he commented in interviews that while it is his vocals, the piano accompaniment seen on screen is not actually his.[71] Neil Gaiman is a fan of David Bowie, and some of Bowie's music has been used on the series (the illustration of Lucifer in the comics is also based on David Bowie).[72]
 
Simultaneously, with the release of Season 5 Part One in 2020, an official soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music, containing cast recordings from all then-released seasons.[73] In 2021 an additional soundtrack with all songs from the "musical" episode "Bloody Celestial Karaoke Jam" was published as well.[74]

It remains an unapologetically sordid, demonically fun hour of TV".[118] LaToya Ferguson of *The A.V. Club* gave it a B grade, calling the episode funny with "genuinely funny moments to come from" and saying that the premiere "starts the season off on a good note". She praised Tom Ellis's performance calling it "pitch perfect".[119]
 
On May 28, 2015, the American Family Association (AFA) website One Million Moms launched a petition to prevent the series' airing.

Ah. It seems like only yesterday (but it was 1991) that the "Concerned Mothers of America" announced that they were boycotting *The Sandman* because it contained lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans characters. It was Wanda that upset them most: the idea of a trans-woman in a comic book... They told us they were organizing a boycott of

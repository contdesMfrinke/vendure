You can access a variety of commands and windows in Visual Studio by choosing the appropriate keyboard shortcut. This page lists the default command shortcuts for the **General** profile, which you might have chosen when you installed Visual Studio. No matter which profile you chose, you can identify the shortcut for a command by opening the **Options** dialog box, expanding the **Environment** node, and then choosing **Keyboard**. You can also customize your shortcuts by assigning a different shortcut to any given command.
 
**Note:** If you visit this page on a Mac, you will see the key bindings for the Mac. If you visit using Windows or Linux, you will see the keys for that platform. If you need the key bindings for another platform, hover your mouse over the key you are interested in.

Most importantly, you can see keybindings according to your keyboard layout. For example, key binding Cmd+\ in US keyboard layout will be shown as Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Cmd+7 when layout is changed to German. The dialog to enter key binding will assign the correct and desired key binding as per your keyboard layout.
 
You can quickly customize the keybinding for user interface actions. Right-click on any action item in your workbench, and select **Customize Keybinding**. If the action has a when clause, it's automatically included, making it easier to set up your keybindings just the way you need them.
 
Keyboard shortcuts are vital to productivity and changing keyboarding habits can be tough. To help with this, **File** > **Preferences** > **Migrate Keyboard Shortcuts from...** shows you a list of popular keymap extensions. These extensions modify the VS Code shortcuts to match those of other editors so you don't need to learn new keyboard shortcuts. There is also a Keymaps category of extensions in the Marketplace.
 
We also have a printable version of these keyboard shortcuts. **Help** > **Keyboard Shortcut Reference** displays a condensed PDF version suitable for printing as an easy reference.
 
If you have many extensions installed or you have customized your keyboard shortcuts, you can sometimes have keybinding conflicts where the same keyboard shortcut is mapped to several commands. This can result in confusing behavior, especially if different keybindings are going in and out of scope as you move around the editor.
 
To troubleshoot keybindings problems, you can execute the command **Developer: Toggle Keyboard Shortcuts Troubleshooting**. This will activate logging of dispatched keyboard shortcuts and will open an output panel with the corresponding log file.

The first keydown event is for the MetaLeft key (cmd) and cannot be dispatched. The second keydown event is for the Slash key (/) and is dispatched as meta+[Slash]. There were two keybinding entries mapped from meta+[Slash] and the one that matched was for the command editor.action.commentLine, which has the when condition editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly and is a built-in keybinding entry.
 
The additional keybindings.json rules are appended at runtime to the bottom of the default rules, thus allowing them to overwrite the default rules. The keybindings.json file is watched by VS Code so editing it while VS Code is running will update the rules at runtime.
 
Note that commands run by runCommands receive the value of "args" as the first argument. So in the example above, workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile receives "languageId": "typescript"  as its first and only argument.
 
You can write a key binding rule that targets the removal of a specific default key binding. With the keybindings.json, it was always possible to redefine all the key bindings of VS Code, but it can be difficult to make a small tweak, especially around overloaded keys, such as Tab or Escape. To remove a specific key binding, add a - to the command and the rule will be a removal rule.
 
Different keyboard layouts usually reposition the above virtual keys or change the characters produced when they are pressed. When using a different keyboard layout than the standard US, Visual Studio Code does the following:
 
When editing keybindings.json, VS Code highlights misleading key bindings, those that are represented in the file with the character produced under the standard US keyboard layout, but that need pressing keys with different labels under the current system's keyboard layout. For example, here is how the **Default Keyboard Shortcuts** rules look like when using a French (France) keyboard layout:
 
**Note:** On Linux, Visual Studio Code detects your current keyboard layout on start-up and then caches this information. For a good experience, we recommend restarting VS Code if you change your keyboard layout.
 
VS Code gives you fine control over when your key bindings are enabled through the optional when clause. If your key binding doesn't have a when clause, the key binding is globally available at all times. A when clause evaluates to either Boolean true or false for enabling key bindings.
 
VS Code sets various context keys and specific values depending on what elements are visible and active in the VS Code UI. For example, the built-in **Start Debugging** command has the keyboard shortcut F5, which is only enabled when there is an appropriate debugger available (context debuggersAvailable is true) and the editor isn't in debug mode (context inDebugMode is false):
 
The list there isn't exhaustive and you can find other when clause contexts by searching and filtering in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor (**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts** ) or reviewing the Default Keybindings JSON file (**Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)**).
 
The editor.action.codeAction command lets you configure keybindings for specific Refactorings (Code Actions). For example, the keybinding below triggers the **Extract function** refactoring Code Actions:
 
In the **Keyboard Shortcut** editor, you can filter on specific keystrokes to see which commands are bound to which keys. Below you can see that Ctrl+Shift+P is bound to **Show All Commands** to bring up the Command Palette.
 
The most frustration thing a developer can experience is keyboard shortcuts changing. This happened to me recently when the Ctrl+space shortcut started auto inserting a member instead of showing the List Members box.

Here is how I fixed it.
 
One popular way for users to optimize their efficiency is to leverage shortcuts to interact with the UI. With Git tasks, like Committing, Pulling, and Pushing being part of your daily workflow, learning how to avoid leaving the keyboard for the mouse can keep you in the zone.
 
Back in the status bar, you can also use the shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+F4** to open the Repository Picker which allows you to quickly switch active repositories, bringing up the Git Repository Window for review.
 
Thanks for checking out ways to boost your productivity with Git keyboard shortcuts. Hopefully, these flows demonstrate how to make incorporating Git into your daily coding sessions easy and unobtrusive.

Git in VS is getting better and better! Please add an option to right click a previous commit and copy the comment to the clipboard or to paste it into the current commit comment box or any other way to easily get a previous commit comment into the current commit comment box.
**Cheers**.
 
I really look forward to some easy way to remove orphaned branches.
Creating always new branches, that get deleted with the pull-request approval, requires here and there my time to delete them one after another.
A one-click solutions would me more than welcome (and obviously VS knows, which branches are still connected to an remote branch indicated by that icon).
 
VSC's keyboard shortcuts are easy to modify, although they're sometimes difficult to find. In case you don't know, in the bottom left corner of VSC is a large "gear" icon, and if you click it, there's a menu item for its keyboard shortcuts.
 
If you use a JetBrains IDE, GitHub Copilot can autocomplete code as you type. After installation, you can enable or disable GitHub Copilot, and you can configure advanced settings within your IDE or on GitHub.com. This article describes how to configure GitHub Copilot in the IntelliJ IDE, but the user interfaces of other JetBrains IDEs may differ.
 
You can use the default keyboard shortcuts for inline suggestions in your JetBrains IDE when using GitHub Copilot. Alternatively, you can rebind the shortcuts to your preferred keyboard shortcuts for each specific command. For more information on rebinding keyboard shortcuts in your JetBrains IDE, see the JetBrains documentation. For example, you can view the IntelliJ IDEA documentation.
 
You can enable or disable GitHub Copilot from within your JetBrains IDE. The GitHub Copilot status icon in the bottom panel of the JetBrains window indicates whether GitHub Copilot is enabled or disabled. When enabled, the icon is highlighted. When disabled, the icon is grayed out.
 
If you are disabling GitHub Copilot, you will be asked whether you want to disable it globally, or for the language of the file you are currently editing. To disable globally, click **Disable Completions**. Alternatively, click the language-specific button to disable GitHub Copilot for the specified language.
 
You can specify which languages you want to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for either in the IDE or by editing your github-copilot.xml file. If you make changes to language settings in your IDE, you can individually select and deselect the languages you want to activate or deactivate.
 
If you make changes to the language settings in your github-copilot.xml file, you can specify individual languages, or
